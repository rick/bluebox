53 20050802201407 Welcome to the most boring site ever. 
74 20030905072207 I dreamt I slept the inverse of time, whatever that means. 
75 20031109090607 dream of ensuring the jack o'lanterns appropriate disposal. 
104 20060221084208 all I remember:  -"What is living?" -"Natural dyeing."  -"What is it, hon?" -"Hon King." 
106 20030902081208 My Pop-Pop following me everywhere, first in the car and then by foot, daffy and clinging. 
109 20060214090407 Somebody telling me that this was a day to honor all the lion-tamers and the lion-caretakers. 
112 20030926063808 "Write me as one who loves his fellow men."      Love and thanks to you, Pop-Pop.  We miss you.  
114 20060816114811 dream posts are moored offshore and offline for a bit whilst i get an anchor in on waking life :-) 
126 20060426091411 -the hair barrettes -- actually far side comics, whole books of them, but darker and more bizarre, less funny. 
129 20060412124409 Again a dream of my viola.  I did not have the music to play for Christ's passion.  Tears in my eyes and stomach. 
132 20060119175408 The middle-aged Middle Eastern men debating over what type of pistachios were in the instant pistachio pudding mix.  
135 20050326104008 Someone asked me to "speak of virtue, and the ninth level of hell", as though I were an expert on both of those things. 
142 20031013093407 Among other things, I dreamt that Barbra Streisand had died and NPR's Morning Edition was doing a retrospective on her career. 
148 20060728085007 Talking with Kelly Jo Garner about maintaining a listserve; warm red wooden panelling and heavily-curtained rooms.  A set of stairs. 
152 20060522153409 Three owls by the harbor.  How I wanted them to settle on my arm, though I knew that would hurt.  They flew off after circling overhead. 
183 20060211081408 Laura Sobik went back to the main desk of the high school gym / locker room where we had gathered, and got us both some orange wedges that were being distributed free. 
204 20060311100208 The free card at the gas station at the intersection of three points.  I took it with the intention ofwriting "samizdat" inside and sending it off, against my better judgement, to someone. 
209 20060705090407 caring-child and other child, both small, under four i'd say, in the middle of the busy intersection kissing the young guy with tattoos sitting on the yellow stripe in the middle of the road.   
219 20030704072608 my left brain knows  I dreamt there was a blender that did not work.  Parts were missing. Then (in real life) I woke up with a start.  It was 5:05, and the sun was up, so I got up and went about my day.  
220 20030507065807 In my dream I dreamt I was lying down in a grey room on a grey day.  There were blankets everywhere.  I was in a place very far away and I was confused momentarily when I woke up in my room this morning.  
222 20030704073208 my left brain knows   I dreamt there was a blender that did not work.  Parts were missing. Then (in reality) I woke up with a start.  It was 5:05 a.m. and the sun was up, so I got up and went about my day.  
233 20060216012608 Over and over, my sisters and I getting kidnapped and chips being placed inside our bodies so that we could be tracked and manipulated.  On a dirty bed with mussed-up sheets a withered and wrinkled old woman naked.    
238 20040628074808 I had forgotten to do my paper on the origins and development of political virtue; but then again, so had everyone else.  I walked through the ruins of a trashed house, looking for relics of the people who had lived there. 
248 20060525101808 the farm at the ragged end of my sight, lacy earth meeting the green fields of the delta.  i hung out in half-sleep for seven minutes waiting for a dream that made sense.  fine rain like mist.  the earth beeping like an alarm clock. 
263 20060414121408 the kids did not want to listen much as i, their visitor,told them the least number of superhero attirbutes and strange physical features their invented animal should have.  i had not prepped the paper on whcihthey would draw their initial sketch. 
269 20050119084008 Over and over again, I kept seeing the phrase "Ego sum emo sum".  An hour floated like a rosy egg above the city with the understanding that if you needed some extra time you could break the glass that surrounded it and live an hour apart from everyone. 
275 20060121111008 The short (26 m 42s) Part Two of Wagner's (in my dream) three-part  Tristan und Isolde .  It was called "Christina's Lament".  When I put it in the cd player I realized it was actually separate tracks, not one long one as I had thought from the cd packaging.  
277 20030430083207 they say I got brains, but they ain't doing me no good   All I can remember from my dreams is getting into a big maroon Cadillac with someone to go pick up ice cream.  The Beach Boy's "Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)" was playing at deafening levels.  
279 20060703054408 esolate traint racks on border of wilderness / civilization step back to avoid debris wasteland person flying up in machinery  night untitled install my friend who needs a place to stay  and the chorus rehearsal  desceni into underworld fourteen stage initiation  
280 20030613104407 Anna Ahkmatova and the spires of Leningrad.  A series of buildings like boxes nestled in one another.  Some occassionally splashes of bright color but everything else rendered stangely grainy, like the screen-printed photos in  Russian avant-garde movie posters .  
291 20030526063808 There was so much more to my dreams than this but all I remember is a wall of rough hewn stone, discolored by time.  It was in the basement of a house.  I was going to hide some things in the wall by pulling out some stone blocks like drawers and placing things inside them.  
304 20060219173607 Karen Melnyk / Dave Trachtenberg visit; strange school; knowledge of the psychic and teleportation power of our group when the reptile alien lords come into the strange, Versailles-like mirrored gym where the woman has teleported herself to the other side of her child's volleyball game.  
305 20030405103807 The owner, a woman with tightly curled hair like a poodle, said, "And so handy with her hands.  She was a barbershopper, you know.  Not someone who sang with a barber shop quarter--though she did that, too.  No, she built that barber shop down the road--framed it herself and everything."  
314 20030501081207 There was no roof above our bed, and the floor of the house stretched out for several hundred feet.  Above the foot of the bed was the wide and blue sky, stretching out above our extended house. Sprouting lily bulbs (they could have been onions) were falling fromt he sky onto the bed.  I woke up.  
324 20030416072607 noise rock   A man standing upright.  Outside, in real life, the noise of bulldozers and wreckers destroying a house and carting away its rubble.  In a repeated vision, there is a table full of papers, shaped like a wheel; I see simultaneously that it is a pair of interlocking gears, shifting and grinding.  
326 20060427133809 -all i really remember is a lady, a cross between meghan finn and aunt ginny, stepping out from the line of students waiting for the bus (i was among thm, on a field trip), announcing that she was leaving for home (she was our chaperone and teacher figure), and saying loudly, "I've got a hunger ... for BEEF!" 
327 20060427133607 -all i really remember is a lady, a cross between meghan finn and aunt ginny, stepping out from the line of students waiting for the bus (i was among them, on a field trip), announcing that she was leaving for home (she was our chaperone and teacher figure), and saying loudly, "I've got a hunger ... for BEEF!" 
348 20030708090808 In a dark office, people getting ready for their hosting duties.  It was the last day of work in the dingy office before summer vacation began.  I glimpsed the comic book featuring the  misadventures of Bill Poole , Daniel Day-Lewis's character from  Gangs of New York .  We heard one of Nick's songs from his new cd on the radio.   
351 20030610101407 Bryce was obsessed with his new business plan, which consisted of  (step one) making linoleum "aprons" for various big name bands  (step three) profit   The linoleum aprons were made with scraps we had lying around the shop. They were shaped in such a way to cover keyboards, guitars and other musical instruments.  They smelled funny. 
358 20030320101408 Very strange.  I don't really remember anything--only that I woke at 7:45 a.m. and thought, "I'll remember that"--it was something about a country music singer and my entire body feeling like it was underwater or moving through heavy concrete.  I know I dreamed between then and now but I don't remember anything, not even shadowy glimpses.   
362 20030516102408 pleating the fifth   My  cousin Samm  was in my bathroom, dyeing her hair red.  The dye had left strange stains all over the bathtub.  My cousin Collin had a harmonica.   Brandon  had received a long piece of handmade paper in the mail, folded accordion-style, and he kept insisting I had sent it.  "I'm not at liberty to say anything," I said.   
365 20060728090807 Talking with Kelly Jo Garner about maintaining a listserve; warm red wooden panelling and heavily-curtained rooms.  A set of stairs.  This was in the house of my childhood.  Next door to our current house a tractor trailer pulled up, red cab and white body.  This was Roger Joynes's truck and he was coming home from the road to check up on his mom. 
390 20060206081607 -yellow dye and the cutch extract  -will hall and the signing in air of everything we did, as a means of establishing what we stood for.  wherever we walked a set of URLs appeared in the air before us  -in the dollar general on 8th, walking through aisles: "you're from tennessee, we're from wisconsin: normally everything is pretty boring but occassionally things happen".  
403 20031013094007 people who need people   Among other things, I dreamt that Barbra Streisand had died and NPR's Morning Edition was doing a retrospective on her career.  Morning Edition featured (in real life) a review of Streisand's new album this morning, and so I wandered around confused for a while after waking up, trying to figure out why Susan Stamberg wouldn't state what had caused Bab's death. 
403 20060330202208 Tedium of dreams of ruined contact lenses, dried out and brittle in the forgotten medicine cabinet.  Our childhood neighbor Nan Guzzetta was not her thin-lipped, bony and rushing self but a round, friendly woman with a concern for Kate's academic well-being.  She wanted Kate to attend CUNY and told us so on the stone patio in front of my parents' door. The willow tree was still there. 
413 20061207061008 underneath the earth where the woman went to give us all french braids the waters of the river were flowing and had changed the surface of the spot where we had planted a garden the season before, or perhaps where we had just cleared the land.  here two river sources came together, crossing at an "x", and split again into three paths, like the forks of a "w", going deeper onward into the earth. 
416 20031114071607 I had met up with a lost friend in a land where there had used to be acres of woods, but now only sparse pockets of trees interspersed with tract-mansion developments.  We spent the night in a small raft moored to the land on the shortest day of the year.  The White Stripes' "I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself" was playing very loudly in my ear when in real life the phone rang and I woke up. 
421 20060829070009 We went to where they were having a yard sale.  I saw Erika Johnson shopping, and some other people from Untitled.  I was really glad to see Erika.  I was going to be late for something.  Wisty Pender was there, and her husband who kept making generalizations about welfare mothers.  Wisty kept trying to find ways to test her husband's conjectures.  I was going to buy a shelf from Wisty and her husband. 
424 20030709085207 I dreamt I had been taught an ancient and nearly-forgotten technique for including a very small line of text/type on a surface that did not even have room for it.  You would make the line of text out of copper; then you would let it oxidize.  Then you would remove the unoxidized copper so only a thin green film remained on a tiny wire.  You would then hang your wire whever you wanted your words to appear. 
428 20030203092608 The Beautiful Blue Danube   I was playing viola in an orchestra and the c-string kept getting more and more frayed.  The outer metal coating kept coiling off.  I got to the end of the piece--there was a repeating figure of a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note followed by a quarter, rising and then falling.  We were playing a waltz, but I didn't realize it--I kept trying to play it in 4/4 time.     
433 20050104135807 Behind the house in Nashville, heavy rains had swept down heavy boulders from on top of the hill.  These rocks gave off a feeling of power.  In my dream I recalled an earlier dream of this same event, and I thought to myself that I was awake and that this was a strange vision to have come true.  Black birds were drinking from a deep puddle beside the dead tree.  A young golden eagle had to be killed to be reborn.  
441 20060319122407 of all the things to leave behind      the russian spoon with the sheaves of grain celebrating the grain harvest  the one my dad gave me   i accidentally let it fall in the slag heap  then i remembered it and picked it up to take along with me  a cat who was kind   another type of strange animal   like a marmot and a weasel mixed   head like a fox   they were comforting me  they walked in and out of windows into our home  
441 20060925083209 said.  Her young man with a shock of white hair was getting upset.  THey looked through the room trying to find her pair of clear glass boots. They would be a perfect match (besides color) to the gold metallic glass boots she had on.  Finally they looked int he washer.  Among the clothes they found them.  The lady put them on.  We alked over to another section of te room, now a laundromat.  "Gently, gently," someone said. 
446 20060607125208 sean keane in the house his sister house-sat for many years ago.  books tumbling on the floor beside the bed -- a small detail.  the friend who owned the house came in.  sean was lonely and watned a girl (?).  the farm.  trying to figure out what it was exactly they were growing amidst the mass of tangled leaves.  at this point i woke up and did some work (in real life) because i had solved the problem of what i needed to do.  
451 20060531072208 dialed the number, all the while repeating her two-word song.  The line rang onthe other side and a somewhat gruff voice picked up.  "God?" she asked, then started talking fast.  "Oh God, no, no," the voice responded.  "This is the military chaplain.  You must have dialed the wrong number."  "Oh,"said the lady, hanging up and beginning to dial again as she started to sing again.  "I could have been sure God gave me a local number." 
466 20060220103408 In an avante-garde film of the 30s, a man and a woman, in their fancy dress clothes, pulled each other into a bedroom.  The woman pulled the man to the bed and the camera panned to a Japanese lacquer screen inthe corner emblazoned with cranes. But then almost immediately the woman said, "It's time fr a shower," and pulling the man upright, disappeared by herself into the next room, only to appear minutes later in full Valkyrie dress as Brunhilde. 
473 20060616101408 the thousands of little mannequins i was making turned into hundreds of manatees, marionettes on string  giving someone a tattoo of the chinese paper cut-out on ben's piece, for good luck and blessing.  this gesture was a final and permanent gesture of goodwill.  as i floated on my back in the sea -- asking "don't you know how to swim?" to the person who did not know how to sleep through the seven minutes of ocean silence provided by the snooze button   
479 20060925083209 a boy.  The youth smiled and jumped up and down hard. the left boot broke.  we were on the other side of the room once more.  the boy witht he boots was freaked out.  as a beautiful japanese woman, about fifty or sixtywith her hair all white, came over and held inher arms the youth witht he white hair,both of htem squatting ont he floor, the youth with the glass boots, one of them broken, stood behind them and made the sign of his throat being slit.     The   
484 20030416080007 noise rock   A man standing upright.  Outside, in real life, the noise of bulldozers and wreckers destroying a house and carting away its rubble.  In a repeated vision, there is a table full of papers, shaped like a wheel; I see simultaneously that it is a pair of interlocking gears, shifting and grinding.    I need to sleep, why won't you let me I need to sleep I need to sleep I need to sleep Why won't you, why won't you let me sleep?  Pavement,  "Fillmore Jive"  
487 20030510120208 the orchestra, my viola solo, the good player playing it rick's copy of his annual report, especially for me, with all the extra stuff in red pen, so no blank space remained  franne lee and her disappearance to ny the public school bathroom and too much stuff--somebody was helping me carry it a strange dispenser on the wall? a strange double-hinged mirror i didn't know was there  i am dreaming le tigre; i am their music i find a big pale turquoise egg, the size of me 
489 20060225102608 The film I had shot and brought to be developed was not what I expected. None of the shots had actually captured what I had planned, but different scenes of much interest -- the iron gate against the open sky, the cast iron tiny alligators, fish and squirrels at the bottom of the creek bed.  Also the film had been developed in color rather than black and white, and mid-way through I had gotten a stack of my cousin Sam's photos, printed two to a very long page, instead. 
491 20060117082408 In my dream I was standing on the edge of Shore Road by the old chimney sweeps' telling someone about my dreams. There was one point where I was talking about my dream within a dream.  Just by us, in the hedge row, a blackened stump of a torn-up tree charred by fire but still intact.  In my dream that I was talking about this had been thrown into the hedge by two dogs.  There the dogs appeared, bounding towards us.  Each beep of the alarm clock was another page printed.  
499 20030807083408 I backed my car down a curvy driveway, hoping to turn it around.  The area was wooded, but land had been cleared all around the house and its two outbuildings.  I'd thought the driveway had stopped at the old carriage barn, but instead it went on, turning into a long bridge over deep cliffs.  Far beyond, the sea in black and white churned up sandy waves full of magnetite and quartz.  New school punks had crept into our house and covered the top of our alarm clock with duct tape. 
501 20060309092208 With a lady who was a cross between Wendy Alexander / Margaret Pesek - sledding down Love Hill on metal garbage can lids.  My mom and dad were shouting; it sounded like an opera.  Gymnasium of the Blair School, now a school of education.  All the students on the other team lined up along the wall.  The challenge had been to come up with choreographed routine for the entire team,then girls,then boys. Very tall.  Watching the others' performance, and practicing on the sly for ours.  
506 20030424142807 "Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote"   I remember very little besides numerous faces and large women in some sort of schoolteacher role.  At some point my father was looking over my book collection.  "Ah yes," he said.  "There's an authentic translation."  It was  Carlos the Jackal , by Miguel Cervantes.  But I'd grouped it with all my other literal translations by Allen Bloom.  It was a word-for-word contemporary translation of a book written a long time ago.  I had never read it.   
507 20031116111008 A song version of D.H. Lawrence's "The Snake", but with different lyrics, to the tune of Paul Burch's "The Last of My Kind".  Research had showed that elephant skin could withstand temperatures of up to 700 degrees.    "We submerged this pachyderm in boiling water," the researcher said, in an annoying 60 Minutes voiceover tone, "and not only did it survive--it frolicked."  Practicing fore a performance of The Rite of Spring with two other people in the unlit halls of a relative's house. 
513 20030409092207 I looked down at my fingers to see what was wrong and I realized that my  ring finger was growing out of my middle finger.  Both of them were the  color of dark bird talons.  Later on, I was making paper under the tutelage of an older woman.  She  had a blender housed in the bottom of a large Quaker Oats canister, and  she kept putting in oatmeal, nuts, raisins, and grass into the blender  to make the paper pulp.  She'd tell me to blend it, but when I did so, all the contents would disappear. 
522 20060606111808 If you slept an even number of hours and woke up at an even numbered hour, then the hours you slept would be a series of comfortable round bubbles that floated above you.  But if you woke up at the odd-numbered hour of seven the hours of your sleep would be elongated lozenges that came towards you like log ride seats.  If you hit the snooze button wach seven minute interval would be a small lozenge that you could get inside like a tanning bed or coffin and at the end of seven minutes it would open up. 
524 20060531075008 "Call God," the young lady was humming tunelessly under her breath.  She dialed the number, all the while repeating her two-word song.  The line rang onthe other side and a somewhat gruff voice picked up.  "God?" she asked, then started talking fast.  "Oh God, no, no," the voice responded.  "This is the military chaplain.  You must have dialed the wrong number."  "Oh,"said the lady, hanging up and beginning to dial again as she started to sing again.  "I could have been sure God gave me a local number." 
531 20060613085007 concrete compass rose, overlooking the harbor and about twenty-five feet in diameter, with initials in it.  I realize thatthe initials are those of Sharon Wilcox and her crew.  "S.P." I recognize as Sharon, "D.P." as Denise Fanning, "S.C" as Sabrina Crespo and there is one more -- perhaps it is Shannon Mahon but I cannot remember.  Each quadrant has the person's initials, then the her initials and those of the guy she's dating.  Reciting a poem in full -- one that is written, but I cannot remember what it was. 
533 20031103081608 I had been told in a dream to stop by Outkast's recording studio, which was right down the block from where I live.  I was caring for a tiny baby who, when I brought it into the wing of my old middle school, was nevertheless able to count up to eight repeatedly.  I brought her to the bathroom, but when I returned someone else was taking care of her.  When I went to pick her up she had turned into a difficult-to-pick-up tiny ant.  I managed to nab her, but she kept metamorphosizing into various types of beetle.   
540 20060406122407 With Karen M. and Andrea M. in a communal study area -- Karen discussing preparations for an upcoming test or thesis defense.  She was studying a subject that combined education, nursing, and medical research.  I needed to leave as I relaized that it was almost 10 o'clock -- the time I needed to begin playing with the Trevecca Orchestra.  In the strange slantways cafeteria I saw Dr. C trying to summon the group, all bunched up in twos and threes discussing things.  I had almost been early but now I ws late, as usual.   
563 20030502092008 My mom grew angry because we refused to settle anywhere but the rice plantations of East Texas--only these plantations looked like Long Island suburbia.  Beat poets mingled with businessmen and soccer moms; the houses spilled over onto each others' lawns, and cars and reaping equipment formed barricades and passageways among the back patios.    My mom showed us her anger by making fun of an old, old man, a son of former slaves, who was in charge of re-seeding the soil and checking to see what minerals and materials needed to be replenished.  
565 20060403162608 fragment  Danielle's Stevie had died or disappeared suddenly, to all of our confusion and regret.  It turned out, though he looked so young, that he was actually 48.  This was an unfortunate and evil age in my dream.  I desperately wanted to send a card to Steve's mom and his brother, but it was only just before I awoke that I remembered Steve's brother's name -- Guy.  When I woke up I heard for several minutes after I woke strands of a Wagner opera, but when I looked and listened for the source of the sound I realized it was only my own head. 
567 20060718102608 Inside house with side-facing kitchen area, really just a long counter with a spot for a sink, mapped on to the far side of my nanny's dining room, but no in that house.  My mom and dad told me how they were moving so I was helping pack stuffup.  The moving man was coming in and starting to take stuff away.  I was separating the things on the counter into stuff that could be stored or put int he truck first, and stuff that we would need more immediately.  I was massaging or kneading a glass pan full of oatmeal and raisins.  It felt like flesh.   
571 20060105103208 Riding my bike down a street simultaneously West End by Tower Records and 25A just before the Mount Sinai Post Office.  Here I saw a projection telling me that if I wanted Jacqueline to work for me I would have had to give her far more notice.  The air was suffused with light as though it were a warm winter afternoon in a Northern European city.  The light was sharp and pale yellow and the colorful street signs and the noise of traffic made me feel like I was in another country.  I was riding my bike through scraps of paper I imagined were balloons. 
571 20060207085008 The artist D. Sinn who people know as Badger needed a place to stay, so I told him to stay at our place even though he doesn't normally sleep inside.  I had told him before he slept to come up with ten places in the U.S. he might possibly go next.  As he slept he would think of them but in doing so he would pull the covers off the bed where Rick and I were sleeping, forcing me to almost fall on the floor.  The clamp light was on in our room casting light onto the ceiling -- Badger would turn it on everytime he had an idea.   It kept waking Rick up.  
574 20060307115407 Flip book of a passage through rocks and caves: the walls were sandy colored rock compacted with time and glistening with subterranean water. Green lichen and seaweed.  Swimming up through the depths of sleep through dark water; the sliver of air between the deep water and the low rock ceiling; everything is heavy and everything in the stop motion frames of old movies.  Instead of flickering the images I see appear and disappear out of darkness as in filmstrips or when a candle, extinguished, is lit again, and the walls dance with shadows momentarily.  
579 20030427114208 two wrongs don't make a right, but three rights make a left   We are driving through a city and I see, in bird's-eye view, how my father's phrase a couple of days ago could be true.  You can make three rights to avoid a left, and come out ahead.    My friend Camie is the dancing queen.  There is a small stage and she is busting it up with her own moves, like an athletic modern dancer.  She's also trying out kung-fu moves, too, as the music grows appropriately syncopated.  My student Damien and others, observing me as I walk through a large former classroom. 
583 20060316085008 John Wayne leading or rather instructing the men on horseback through a tunnel, naturally made, of red sandstone.  John Wayne stayed at the end to ward against the Comanche who were riding against the party.  Inside the tunnel the camera panned across the weary faces of the men who led their horses, obviously spooked, through the red tunnel with the bumps on the roof like reverse stegosaurus plates.    The funny pictures of me and others hung up on the wall in the greasy spoon.  For some reason I would not go into work today, or would not go in until after 11.  
588 20031104222007 korea, chorea, career   I dreamt I was having my hair cut by the patriarch of a styling family. The man was Arabic and his children, whose own barber chairs were all lined up next to each other so they could stand shoulder-to-shoulder and cut, all had beautiful long blue-black hair.  I was supervising the cutting of Rick's hair and I kept accidentaly backing into the person to my left.  I looked next to me to apologize, and it was Brandon wearing a red and white gingham shirt.  I was at a loss for words, and so I hemmed and hawed for a while before leaving the room. 
590 20031108073408 Offering to give Kristin Urrutia, Kate and Sarah's childhood friend, a chance to cast a pumpkin out of clay.  A child insistent on making some sort of colored sitball "candies".  Once again I was a teacher.  Drumming out, with the noise of my feet against the countertop, my father's tale of pre-, during, and post-WWI and WWII.  Turning up earth with my hands as though I wished to churn up a fallow field.  Eating disgusting mixed nuts from a no-frills can, peanuts out of the shell coated in fake caramel and riddled with mildew.  Soaring above a precipice: I was a hawk. 
595 20030615072807 A day not much different than today--grey and overcast.  Scraping up piles of earth and grass in a public park by a school--when I exposed the dirt underneath the grass, large black ants came bubbling to the surface.  Women were making tiny fetishistic tipis of sticks and flower garlands, like the  bowers built by bowerbirds .  I was supposed to build one for my mom.    Inside, a woman was teaching me to bow in the traditional Burmese style.I was a natural.  We had a "proofing alarm clock", which allowed us to test out a length of sleep before we actually slept through it. 
599 20060117010008 In college.  Wood panelling and backstage mirrors, behind the room where Lana and Mick slept, the hotel carpet a dingy green like the one on our stairway growing up.  There inside the communal bathroom, rows of enclosed toilets, in the changing area with the row of round bulb mirror lights, was Leah Meussig with a message or a challenge for me.  Earlier perhaps a house with rooms like nesting egg cups, impossible staircases the size of dolls.  Perhaps it was a doll's house.  It floated above my eye in front of cafes and up narrow staircases.  I do not remember this dream well. 
623 20060601081210 -a variation of sudoku where one put the letter "B" in each box.  the game was very simple, yet people enjoyed it because it was so soothing.  -story of the japanese woman, one of the most famous ladies ever, laying on her side with trumpet flowers growing out of her mouth.  this is her method of gardening.  what is important, she realizes, is the expression of her personal relationship to the flowers (?).  this also involves hitting the snooze button on the alarm clock multiple times.  each patch of seven minutes is another patch of ground within the garden and the woman must try to traverse it all. 
624 20060306080808 There were many things that transpired but of them I remember only really investigating the back streets of Donna, TX late at night, in a dangerous part of town where people went to make drug deals and kill one another.  This part was on a cliff that was not very tall but fell off sharply.  Later I was very annoyed by the representations of women in literature, and the ways in which this influenced our historical understanding of their role in daily life at that time.  I was telling my companion about this over and over again in a very wearying way.  I wanted to stop talking about it but I could not.  
635 20030614110608 I was climbing, mug in hand, across and over the shiny metal of a bus. In a classroom, I was realizing that I had not finished a cumulative project for one of my education classes.  I was upset not only because it wadue, but because my project was so cool and now I might lose the momentum to do it.  It was a mobile with intricate hand-made paper figurines and scenes dangling from it.    Talking with the instructor, trying to figure out how to get the picture to her--she was talking about me having to do an additional letterhead design because I was turning in htis project late--I was remembering all my students. 
638 20031115203607 chairman of the board   My dad had a dream last night that he told me about this evening.  He was standing in a suite of offices, talking to someone in charge, a foreman-figure.  The foreman was looking around, concerned with the people going by, doing their business.  "Well, I need the chairman's number," my dad told the foreman.  The foreman fumbled around in his pockets, obviously distracted, and handed my dad a number.  My dad hurried off to other errands.  The foreman stood in the middle of the busy building, then turned suddenly to someone at his left.  "Christ," he said.  "I just gave out Sinatra's number."  
660 20030427000207 someday I will begin posting dreams in the morning again   My mom said that it was time for some Elvis Costello.  There was a puppy dog I wanted to adopt.  It was big and small at once.  Though it seemed big and black at first, it then turned small and white, tiny enough to hold in my arms.  It was both sizes and both colors at once.  Beef jerky was $7.99 a stick.  It was a hoity-toity store I was standing in, trying to pull the jerky out of old fashioned glass candy containers so I could see its price.  There was a sewing machine with lots of fabrics.  Somebody was sewing canary yellow lace on the inside-out seams of some blue jeans.   
678 20030529070807 shine on you crazy diamond, vol. II   In the open, rough-floored upper storey of a barn, I was helping people get ready for an art exhibit.  I had pieces in the show, but they were not what I had planned to put in.  They were giant arrows painted on the floor pointing to where my pieces would have been had I made them on time.  There was a green wool army blanket piled in the corner beneath a window; it actually had been used to wrap a sculpture for transportation.  In its carefully disarrayed condition, however, it was  Brandon's  piece.   Rick  was helping me construct boxes of all sizes.  All the arrows were slowly transforming into luminescent stars. 
680 20031112112007 to carry water in a sieve  Trying to sketch out  images to be silkscreened --I came up with several designs.  There were several more that when I woke I could not remember, but they were all boring, except for one in which I had used light and shading to create a sculptural effect.  I recalled something I had learned, in childhood, about bears--perhaps from an oversized National Geographic Kids book.  Later making arrangements so that some man could sit next to the semi-famous artist he and his wife had gotten to come in and work with our class.  Trying to fill a plastic tub with water, but the sieve like plastic grating on all its four sides prevented me. 
689 20031212083008 Somebody playing the same song over and over: "Come true; it's only divine right."  Driving along the twisty country roads at almost sunset, the woods engulfed by autumn, oak and maple the same dull flat rainslicker yellow, so that it seemed, at the end of the day, that they still burned with the heat of the sun.  In the hills that I passed by the homes of the rural poor.  A voiceover in my head from the National Committee on Democracy and Freedom:  "Let your New York congressperson know: Freedom from fear is not an inherent right of freedom."  In my head I felt that perhaps the word "right" should be changed to "outgrowth".  Earlier, at my Granny's house, somehow. 
690 20030302011207 my fangs have been pulled   This is from Friday night, really, but I just remembered it.  I was comparing my teeth with those of my friends'.  My friend  Bryce  had really nice straight white teeth, I noticed.  I looked at mine in the mirror.  They were jagged and and decayed-looking, as though they were in the advanced stages of periodentitis. The oddest thing about them was that they were growing out of gums inverted--the end of my teeth were rooted in my gums, while the  root of each tooth  was readily visible.  Because I have to go to the dentist for a cleaning--and for one of my "royal teeth", a crown--I have some variation of this dream about once a week now.  
690 20030427000808 someday I will begin posting dreams in the morning again   My mom said that it was time for some Elvis Costello.  There was a puppy dog I wanted to adopt.  It was big and small at once.  Though it seemed big and black at first, it then turned small and white, tiny enough to hold in my arms.  It was both sizes and both colors at once.  Beef jerky was seven dollars and ninety-nine cents a stick.  It was a hoity-toity store I was standing in, trying to pull the jerky out of old fashioned glass candy containers so I could see its price.  There was a sewing machine with lots of fabrics.  Somebody was sewing canary yellow lace on the inside-out seams of some blue jeans.   
705 20030805095008 In a big open-air auditorium, hundreds of students and teachers were gathered for an assembly.  On a small screen, way in the front, song lyrics scrolled across an opening no more than a foot-and-a-half across. Songs blared across the loudspeaker.  It was karaoke day.  Later, in the reception line for a Pakistani wedding, I piled sugar-coated strawberries and mounds of whipped cream on my plate, then tried to grab what I though was fish.  But the casing on the outside broke open when I touched it with tongs to reveal putrid red meat and a long vial of red blood.  "Putrefying meat.  A German delicacy.  That's why it's grouped with the desserts, see?"  the woman ahead of me said.    
708 20030417083607 Something was in my eye.  I walked over the mirror to see what it was.  When I reached down in my eye, there were two extra contact lenses floating around down there.  I took them out and put them in a tub with other lenses to disinfect them.  I walked into a public restroom.  There was a combination valet/maitre d' guy, a fellow from Emory, standing behind an oak podium.  A lot of people were puking in stalls.  Many of the stalls had no doors--only shower curtains that in some cases did not extend all the way to the floor.  I tried using a stall with a full shower curtain, but there were two sections, each extending halfway acroos a three foot bar, and one side kept falling down.    
717 20030609092008 I was driving around with a dapper old man and another friend.  We were driving by the water.  Tall trees, populated by ibis and with some other exotic birds, rose up from the water.  It was dawn.  Suddenly I realized that I could see clearly without my glasses.  I had been down in the Valley on vacation, only it was a strangely cool and temperate place.  I had been helping to test children.  Sarah was talking about her friend Beth working at McDonalds.  She was going to go get their special sauteed vegetables.  Laura Barrientos was walking through the halls of high school, but not before she spotted Mr. Reyes and another teacher flirting.  It was 9:05; it was time to go and meet our friends. 
720 20030712133408 unreal city   I dreamt the longest bridge in the world stretched like a suspended  sword between the city of New York and the farthest point of Long  Island's South Shore, where all you can see is the Atlantic, endlessly  rolling.  I drove and drove across the bridge, not realizing I  travelled hundreds of feet above the sea, no land beneath me.  It was  only halfway out I realized I was on a bridge, no way back, only the  choice to drive on to the end, to the point where civilization and land  ended.    The bridge was over a hundred miles long, glittering like a silver city  in the sparkling light above the water.  The shoreline of the East  Coast had curved inward, like a neverending spiral.   
726 20060627082207 Rick had very graciously woken me up and bundled me up so that I could go off to work.  But on the way there I realized that I didn't have any food or drink and that I was dressed hideously.  We saw Finer Things -- everything had been taken out of the boutique, everything taken out of the gallery.  Kim told me I would need to put things back up "to help get everything rolling."  We were driving through a dead wood of dead trees.  Someone had put white plastic newspaper bags on the top of some of them.  We stopped at a Foodland.  I was thinking about the place where Allen Ballman and Christine McDonald were oving: Kalamazoo.  Over and over the phrase "Mirfak, Mirfak, Mirfak" was going through my head.  
731 20060911143009 we drove along the river, which we had thought in dreams within dreams to play by and swim in.  but rains had come and made the river flood its banks and swirl angrily past torn up branches.  men worked in the river to haul out pieces of plywood and tree roots that threatened navigation and their own lives.  as we drove we realized the road itself was flooded, was water, was the river.  no one could drive on it though rick was trying his best to navigate.  cars and trucks kept coming toward us, careening and nearly missing colliding with us and with themselves.  we were on a tall ship in the dark.  rick, with his old face, mustchioed and bearded, went off with rachel giordano.  they swam out into darkness. 
741 20060109102208 It was 9:30; I knew that I had missed the bus that drove by my parents' driveway, but I went outside to wait anyway.  Down at the corner elementary school kids were getting on a bus that had the route around the corner down to the harbor.  Another bus came from the opposite direction and picked up some older kids, then began driving up Shore Road.  It slowed down where my old bus stop used to be and so I ran up to it, and the doors opened and I went inside.  Jay Brazier and some other kid were sitting in front of me.  Jay was very civil.    There was an old gutted schoolhouse on the edge of Edna and Steve's property.  In fact, their entire lawn was dotted with old structures they had dug up or located in the woods.  
746 20030727014808 my memory fails me   Tatie our Brazilian friend had her visit cut short by interfering high school administrators.  I suddenly realized it was the last day of school, ever, and I hadn't said goodbye or thanked anyone or told them how much I would miss them.  My yearbook without any signatures a catalog of lost encounters.    People were doing yoga on display in a darkened gymansium and I was among them, feeling self-conscious.  I wished that we were having a dance party like the one my sister and my little cousin Elizabeth had had to the music of Aretha Franklin, in real life.    The walk at night, the apple deer and insect bites.  I had forgotten my keys.  A man with a giant egg cupped in his hands, asking for water.    
748 20031205101607 Fri. 5 Dec.  In the department store where I have been in so many dreams before. First in some sort of groceries/fresh produce section, and then, inexplicably, by the ladies' tights and undergarments.  I wanted to buy lots of colored tights, but the display I had seen just seconds before was gone.  In the distance I glimpsed where there might be more, but we had to go.  A long car ride, through rolling farmland.  I am talking with the driver, a middle-aged woman.  Then we are in a roadside cafe getting food for our journey.  It's kind of a fancy sit-down place, and my only real options are a yogurt and fruit or a big plate of fish, awkwardly priced at 1 pound and "at liberty" increments.  It is going to be a long journey.  
751 20060706090608 There was Shirin. Her locker was next to a girl from high school's who I had always quasi-admired for her toughness. Also Danielle Sered was there at some point.  Great tenderness for allt he people fromt he past that I encountered.  Later, a rude man was being kicked out of our gathering.  I felt bad for him because I didn't think that he actually knew how to act.  I talked with him, trying to understand him, but really more trying to make him feel understood.  I left my purse, the quilted one with the teapot Rick's grandma made for me, out on top of my books on a cafeteria-style table outside.  When I returned, it was not there (as I feared might be the case).  I willed myself to know that it would be in the lost and found. 
753 20030412094208 I was playing pool with my friends in a wood panelled windowless room. My shot--I hit the cueball and all the other balls rolled off it like water. Three stripes went in the pocket as though they were rolling to the sea.  Oh no!  Three solids followed them, just as easily.  Just before I woke up, I dreamed that time was a glowing band around my clock.  Certain times produced stronger vibrations than others--indeed, 7:18 and 7:42 were such powerful times of day that I would be able to feel the vibrations and heat that their glowing bands produced even without setting my alarm clock.  This was not true in real life, as I discovered when I woke up at 8:23.  In real life you need to set your alarm clock to wake up at these times.   
759 20060117115807 In my dream I was standing on the edge of Shore Road by the old chimney sweeps' telling someone about my dreams.  When I talked about my dream within a dream, there I glimpsed, just within the thicket, a blackened stump of a torn-up tree charred by fire but still intact.  I recognized it from my dream as, further up and earlier down the road, I had recognized the charred heart of the tree and its arm of cherry, one curving line with the bark blackened like cinders.  "How strange," I said to the person I talked to, "this in my dream had been thrown into the thicket by two large dogs."  There the dogs appeared, bounding towards us.  Each beep of the alarm clock was another page printed.    ---   ---   above:  K'un, The Receptive - Earth
764 20050331112808 A lady was standing outside the door at Finer Things Gallery, waiting to be let in.  Her face was thin like a bird's and she had long wavy blond hair.  Her face was familiar but I did not know her name.  I realized jut as I woke up that she was the visible manifestation of an ancient god.  I had woken up because it was raining and water was coming in the window.  I shut the window and looked at the lightning.  When I went back to sleep the dream resumed.  The woman returned, but it was her second visit.  I realized that on her first visit she had been Zeus and on this second one Apollo.  She stood there without moving; something about the unchanging stoic composition of her face was more terrifying and awful than anything I had ever seen. 
766 20030403081207 Just before I woke up, I'd convinced myself in my dream that Rick wasn't going in to work this morning and I could sleep until 8:25.  But in the dream we were slowly waking up anyway.  I peeked around the corner of our bedroom and discovered that we had a whole 'nother bathroom.  Someone was running water for a bath inside of it.    A cat surfaced from beneath the bed.  Neither of us understood how it oculd have been there all night without making itself noticed or Rick sneeze.  It had a wolf-like head.  Rick was trying to decide what he could read next.  He had the Song of Songs and the Psalms, and he was thinking aobut reading either of these--only he had been lugging his versions around "for three days", and was tired of carrying them.   
771 20060227102608 Where we lay on the ground with the mountains beyond, blue and gold in the morning sunrise, and extending far as the eye could see; there was a door behind us but it was painted to look the same as these mountains. I was trying to figure out why the other people were laying down around us but we were up walking around.  Looking out around and across the mountains again, small shrubs and olive and cypress trees like in Tuscany, with the light still rising like early morning, I realized that we were in heaven, but we weren't supposed to be there yet.  We were walking tot he exit and god would escort us out to let us back in when we were ready.  We slid down a hill to get there faster.  The people behind us were stretched out and almost flattened.  
774 20060523075008 (from notes I made when just waking up):  handbook of the three Guatemalas:  I. speech acts / II. kinship relations / III. the sphere of actual social everyday living (the true "guidebook", the preceding two volumes a critique and exposition of the underlying forms of culture)  horse-trollers (?) / shadowers / handlers  "if we live in a universe where as it is it seems everything is already rolling down hill, what special privilige it gives us to think every individual drop already put into action by a god.  this conception lost in a flat world."  the scene of the many individual drops of water, each conceptualized as and signifying an individual horse-handler, and the human form of the horse-handler narrator dwarfed by and moving among these drops.
786 20061031111012 The thin veil between the worlds of sleeping / waking thinner now as the season slips.  Yesterday morning I got out of bed with a start to get the change from my purse for the blonde-haired woman who showed up in the deserted old shop to put on an art show.  Only she was in my dream and I was awake and looking for loose change that did not exist in the bag in the other, real room.  So I went back to bed without the coins to pass over the river into the underworld of sleep.  Last night in the studio waking suddenly and seeing before me the long legs of the posionous spider, sinister and precise.  Sarah tried to hold the blanket away from me and then I realized wiht a start that the vision before my eyes was not real and that I was alone in the room in the dark. 
799 20060209083808 In the halls of my high school, I glimpsed my old friends but there I also saw Franne Lee.  When she asked if I had emailed a list of membership coordinator duties to the person taking over that role, I stood there with her and tried to list all of the responsibilities that person would have.  I didn't know if she was listening.  For Les's birthday, Rick had gotten Les a big puzzle of a small troll-like girl walking down the lane trying to sell paper hearts in a basket to a bunny. Les said he needed to build muscle so he was going to take up swordfighting.  There was a set of mini-binoculars with a spot on top to cook collard greens through solar energy.  Someone had put it pack in its case without cleaning it off completely.  There were pancakes for breakfast downstairs.  
804 20061217000209 dream of 12/10:  the end of the world, dirt dump, miles of it, towering above cracked and parched, and around and miles distant the spires and hoodoos of bryce canyon, alien form, same color of dirt as the dump dung hill.  & suddenly, small pieces of it falling in the distance.  because everything is the same now at the end of the world the far is made near. & now the dirt is falling near us as not dirt but stone, huge rocks capable of bone crushing.  we try to flee down the hill.  the path has gone.  we slide down the canyon -   dream of 12/15:  i hold the baby jesus in my parents' living room, stripped down to show the white concrete walls, looking like a stable.  my aunt ginny coos over the baby, "the only child of the first christian woman and a jewish man".  it is a girl.

861 20030520073407 all i can say, is that my life is pretty plain   Driving around the roundabout in Harlingen.   Blue sky and incessant sun, the parched look of drought.  There had been no rain in Harlingen, I thought--yet the people I ran into were arguing that it had rained every day.  Perhas, I acknowledged, from a certain point north on.  The two women walking through the reststop with the man, looking at fancy cars, the man telling all about their history.  In my head the story of the man who sacrificed himself because he believed himself to be the salvation or the king of all the world, I couldn't tell which.  It turned into an art show Bryce was having with his friends.  His was a piece on a man committing suicide.  Bryce's piece, a piece of flashing handmade paper, turned into a pulsating light, turned into the alarm clock ringing at 6:27 a.m. 
865 20030321083008 My friend Danielle and I were still roommates; we were chasing each other around the upstairs room in our Nashville house, threatening each other with half-eaten decrepit-looking gummi bears. Outside, a strange man was smoking on our porch landing.  I looked out the window again; it had started to snow.  On the television, some mid-80s movie featuring Michael J. Fox in a white man's afro was playing.  He was crawling through the duct work of some school.  His blue eye shadowed girlfriend was trying to talk to him through the duct when the mean high school principal came up to her.  The principal shook her head.  "If you mean to say, Sheila," she began, then shook her head in horror as a box, apparently with Michael J. Fox inside of it, began moving across the floor.  "That," the principal said, "is a SPOON."  But I knew she meant "rat."  
866 20060103152607 There in the east beyond the darkened hulls of the blind buildings the slow parade of hot air balloons.  This was the world famous New Mexico Macy's Hot Air Balloon Night Parade.  The balloons were the fantastic shapes of towering thunderclouds at sunset, or the circus animal procession of the drunk Dumbo's vision, and they shimmered heat mirage-style in pearlescent colors like bath beads.  And Erika was driving a bunch of us to an Untitled meeting that I dind't know we had, but when I leaned out the window as we made the right hand turn away from the far-off parade, shouting "BALLOONS!" at the top of my lungs, she was not amused and in fact looked at me quite sternly, which made me sit back in my seat thinking rather confusedly and childishly that perhaps there was no place I really wanted to be but under the desert night sky, by myself. 
880 20060425125808 -eating the mulberries in the garden of immortality.  we weren't supposed to be there and indeed, no one knew that these berries were for eating.  because it was dusk and the berries were high, i was shaking the branches to gather them, but this meant when i went to share the berries with some of the immortals -- noble looking youths of mixed race -- i looked down to find someof them unripe -- but  ot small and wrinkled like normal unripe mulberries, but smooth and bright green like olives, and with a similar astringent, bitter taste.  -kim brooks was telling me to go get the binder of children's furniture to show a potential client.  another client had just written us a nasty email terminating relations -- because he had gotten several emails from us in a row by mistake.  we thought his actions strange and incommensurate with the actual circumstances. 
895 20030711000608 all tomorrow's parties   I woke with that song in my brain, but I couldn't remember the words,  or the tune--only a snitch of the title: "All...".  Then a dash and a  vision of what had been going through my head all the time I dreamt,  scene after scene of social engagements and family functions, a parade  of relatives and small talk, backyard barbecues and listening in  silence to a discussion of something I did not have anything to  contribute to.  And then a dream of driving my Aunt Regina's car, near  mishaps with the other cars swerving around the road, myself careening  off the side of the road at one point, driving in the culvert before  righting the car and getting back on the asphalt.  In the plane I slept again, as I always do as the plane takes off, but  my sleep was spotty, a dream of walls compressing, punctuated by the  real life wailing of a child.    
908 20030908093607 9/8  I was sitting in the back row in orchestra practice, but an older man, about 35, kept bumping into me.  He was standing up and reading the orchestra pieces off our stand.  My stand partner asked if I wanted to use only the top page from each of our pieces, then look over the shoulders of the people in front of us to read the rest of the music from their stands.  Mr. Coffey, my 12th grade orchestra teacher, was telling everyone it was time to pack up.  "Time to switch to flute," someone shouted, running past.  We were supposed to join the flute section.  Over by the floor-to-ceiling window, where I had placed my viola case, my friend Laura was standing.  She had been giving flute lessons, but some of her Cnadian students just didn't understand when lessons were over.  "It will be my break," Laura said, "and time for me to go, and they'll just stand there.  They don't get it." 
927 20060808083608 Rachel Giordano was there and I was going to try to talk with her.    Some people who were important to a presentation that was going to be put on kept leaving hte trailer where we were sitting to go and dance inthe rain.  THough I thought to myself that I might want to dance in the rain sometime, too, I was angry at them for leaving our friedn who was about to start his presentation.  The people outside kept singing Kris Kristofferson songs.  I tried to park our car in a tiny space under a shaded pavilion by the beach.  There was an old Shakespearian era poem about how corrupt governments tended to perpetuate themselves.  There was a contemporary version of the poem which had been written clandestinely by a North Korean poet of the early 20th century:  See how the winding melon vine Grows propelled by its own wind Sending down warm, sour breath To the bulbous face of an old man growing on its end  
928 20060313104208 Once again I had not gone to Mrs. Silberto's social studies class in ages.  But I was so mad!  Why should I have to repeat high school over again when I was twenty-seven?  It wasn't even like I hated social studies.  I just always forgot to go, or went to viola lessons during that period instead.  In fact, as I stood in the hallway I could not remember if I was scheduled for a lesson then or not.  I began to feel anxious.  When I emerged from the intermission of the symphony concert -- with my strange outfit pulled from the drawers of my sister's clothes, which my mom had so neatly organized and which I had disrupted -- I realized that my community orchestra was having a rehearsal I was supposed to attend.  I looked at the clock.  It was already nine p.m.  I was trying to join them but we needed to locate the upright bass player, who was carrying his bass downstairs, unaware that there was practice. 
939 20060217083608 Talking on my phone to my old student Tony Trejo.  I was at my parents' house and my mom had just given me a vintage green flowered dress to wear.  She was talking about how she hated to make dishes for potlucks and I agreed.  There was a little kitten that I was trying to play with with a piece of rope.  But the rope frayed and the fibrous frayed part got stuck to the kitten's claw so that wherever it was running the rope actually shot out ahead of it.  I was trying to catch up with the kitten to get the rope off of its claw and finally, in the center of the room, I got it to stand still.  "Here," I said, pantomiming draping the rope over a box and taking a big rock and smashing it against the frayed part.  The kitten looked at me, then lifted the rope and put it across a box.  I pantomimed lifting the small rock again. "Okay," it said, in an ape-like voice, and lifted up a rock and hit the rope and was free. 
943 20060320171808 old jerusalem   my nanny asking in a reproachful tone, "where did you find those pants?" the pants she is referring to are the black pants i have been wearing for the past several days.  somewhere off lafayette street in what i find is a shared studio space for shana and joe.  there are two garage doors -- one shut, one pulled to just two-and-a-half feet off the ground.  at first it is twilight and i am looking in the back for a painting beth gilmore has left for me. but i cannot find it yet.  it is raining and misting in the back and the roof of the building has torn off here, or never was.  then it is night in the ruined wreck of an old city torn by war.  there is rain pounding on the roof.  i am afraid of people coming in off the street into the garage space while my back is turned.  i vow not to be afraid.  in my hands over and over again i am turning a square canvas.  i do not know what is on the other side.  
945 20030606093808 no man is an island   Storms were brewing over the sea as I sat on the beach.  Some people were walking on water, far out on the sea.  The water was flat and oily-looking.  One couple, a mother and daughter, ran across the falttened waves to get to the beach.  Other groups soon followed suit.  The sky kept giving off charges of electricity, columns of lightning  unaccompanied by thunder.  Our downstairs had been transformed.  Brandon and Rick and another guy were sitting around the kitchen table.  I was going to paint a big bell on a dark sheet of paper -- multiple copies to paste around town.  "Ask not for whom the bell tolls," it said on the bottom.  Much later I was running an indoor marathon.  I ran with David Jackson and Steve (Buck) Rodgers, from my high school days.  On a large sheet of paper/canvas -- almost 8 ' x 11' --I was putting down bold areas of watercolor so that I could do a huge block print over it.
946 20060615114007 teaching again and this time, i will, i swear, get all my students to read.  there is sonny as he was when he first came to class, cherub-faced and eager to learn.  we will try again to have stations so that some students can practice phonics and spelling, others listen to books i record for listening comprehension and fluency, while others meet with me to read-one-on-one.  i know that it will be a lot of work to prepare each day but i am so confident that all of my students will learn.  there is kevin rangel toying around with electric wires and some things that look like shortened guitar or camera bag straps, behind where the voice recorder is.  information is embedded in these wires and can be swapped in and out easily.  kids can wear them around their heads or on their shoulders and listen but we will use them in a stationary way in the classroom.  +---------  ---------   above:  Ch'ien, The Creative - Heaven, Sky
952 20030418080408 A grunge rocker was standing within the glassed storefront of a giant music building.  A man and I were trying to get, but we couldn't--the entrance we tried to use was soldered shut.  The man inside saw us and moved around to a side entrance to let us in.  His hand movements indicated that the door we were trying to get in was closed and that he would open another one for us.  His hand movements were reminiscent of  the motions of another person behind glass I had seen earlier in my dream.  Before, Doug Feltman, a guy I had gone to school with, had turned in a very late final copy of his paper for school.  It had an old-school bit-map image of a computer, circa 1986 Apple.  His new copy was neatly presented, but the version he's handed in before was tattered and riddled with cross-outs, handwritten sections, and misspellings.  He'd gotten a big red fifteen on it.  But on an earlier paper, he'd gotten a minus twenty-five.  
957 20060420083208 Everything took place in or near Finer Things Gallery.  Somebody (my cousin Caitlin?) told me one could wind up being a good person no matter which of the fifty U.S. states one lived in.  A number of repair trucks and then, strangely, a set of demolition derby buses were all going by on the auxillary tracks in front of the gallery.  Lula Licious came by in a car.  I waved to her and she came over to where Margaret and I were standing to ask if we would go to the Panty Raid show this weekend.  We probably wouldn't because we were having a party ourselves, I explained.  She kept referring to it as a wedding and I ust have looked pretty puzzled because she finally asked, "You didn't see the announcement on Myspace?  We're celebrating my wedding that evening to William, youngest brother of the Jacksons.  Because he was adopted into the family only fourteen weeks ago, I didn't have to sign any non-disclosure agreements or anything." 
976 20031109234607 Matthew Neal's aid in devising an appropriate means of disposing of the rotten pumpkins on our front porch.  The heated pool, by night; my entry into it after almost locking the keys in the car.  A night clear and dark like the polar solstice.  Through the dark water swimming and swiftly reaching the opposite side.  The group of two young women, two young men; the one woman steadying me when I rose from the water with my eyes closed as though blind or just born.  Damien and other former students admiring my revealing bathing suit, making me uncomfortable.  The jewel like new buds of the honeycatcher tree, giver of sweet sap and attractor of insects and birds, lover of river sides and producer of hungry upward shoots--these hung like suspended mangrove roots, jutting from the topmost branches, straight up until they hit the tin roof of the greenhouse canopy above them.    My student Brittany's birthday cake and my Nanny looking for her lost items. 
987 20031209013008 1) Mice running around a living room--one chasing another until finally a cat noticed them as they ran under my parents' old couch, in its second long ago upholstered state.  Quick as a wink the cat was under the couch, then back out again, with one dead mouse and one live one between its teeth.  It dropped the dead one on the floor and quickly killed the other one.  Sis Sass had to take the dead mice out to the garbage, their remains oozing copious amounts of blood.  But when I looked again they had turned into turkey carcasses.  2)  Cleaning out stuff in Mom's cluttered corner by the piano.  I found a bunch of Christmas related stuff to put out--some old books; Lucy, my first china doll, knickknacks of wood, metal and clay.  3) I had repaired the horrendous "Blue." posters--I'd put in a typeset center with all the info and a little golden placard at the bottom that read "BLUE".  Then when I woke up in real life I almost cried because it was just a dream.  
1002 20030312080607 We have dreamt the world. We have dreamt it as firm, mysterious, visible, ubiquitous in space and durable in time; but in its architecture we have allowed tenuous and eternal crevices of unreason which tell us it is false.   -Jorge Luis Borges,  Avatars of the Tortoise   Dreams that seemed mundane continuations of my waking life...I was playing and recording viola for a band.  There was an infinite amount of time between the current time and 7:30, when I had to stop (and wake up), because we kept splitting the remaining time in half.  There was a comic strip character, all sketchily drawn in black ink and tight pants, parachuting into the recording studio and into the remaining time; somehow motion was able to splinter and shatter the remaining time and  allow us to move forward .   Arie  had written me an e-mail message that at the time seemed very important, but which I have now forgotten.  Earlier, Les, Rick's brother was walking about and doing therapeutic exercises.  
1008 20060202081007 I was searching for the Grail which made a beeping noise suspiciously like my alarm clock.  It turned out to be merely a folded piece of paper that let you know in what ways precisely you would grow to resemble your father.  I drove to Kentucky and left the car running in the street in front of RIck's mom's house.  All sorts of maneuverings and re-parking of multiple cars were occuring.  When I went to refind my car, I could not. For a moment I thought I had driven Rick's car, but I realized I did not know how to drive stick.  Finally I located the Malibu.  It was so dirty that I hadn't recognized it.    Down the street, the old mansion that was permanently in repair was finally finished, but the owners had done a strange post-modern smooth brick treatment on its exterior.   Whatever repairs had yet to be done, they had simply covered with a perfectly flat shell of dark brick.  They had cleared all the trees on the property and the home looked starkly modern, but also ancient.  
1019 20031210093008 good-bye, mrs. pappadapolous, and thanks   As part of a Nashville vice or police squad, I was participating in a midnight raid in a whorehouse located soemwhere along 7th Avenue S.  I was having trouble parallel parking my car, so I tried pulling into the parking lot--but it said "Private Parking--For Employees Only", and for some reason I felt like I should obey the posting.  My car turned into a bike anyway as I was turning around, and I brought it to the porch.   I walked inside and realized that I had been inside this house before. I looked up at the wall in front of me to spot the mural that I remembered had been there, the one of all the prostitutes that currently worked at the house arrayed in flowing white robes and depicted as the nine Muses and the three Graces.  But the mural was gone; only flaking chips of plaster exposed, like ghostly faces in a tarnished mirror, the haunted and disconnected eyes, lips, and hands of the erased women.  (Thanks to  Samm  for the picture link.)  
1024 20030113124007 Just another case of American Blind Justice, Part I  I was sitting at a fold-out card table in a large, almost-empty cafeteria.  A curly-haired woman (I'd classify her as "poodle-permed") was sitting across from me, filling out forms.  I had been called in for  "judge duty", and now I was to hear the cases and pass judgement upon five or six young men, who one by one shuffled in and stood by the table awaiting sentencing.  After finishing the hearings and making my rulings, I stood up, confident that I had acted justly, pleased that I had done my civic duty.  "One hundred thirty dollars," said the curly-haired woman. I stared blankly.    "One hundred thirty dollars," she said again.  "The judge fee?  Remember?"  I stared indignantly this time.    Then, from dim recesses of memory I recalled the contract I had signed earlier in the day amid a flurry of papers and forms.  Yes, it had said something about a fee I'd have to pay "for proper fulfillment of duties."    I sighed and took out my Visa.  
1024 20060204083807 Met Laura Sobik within her old house at midnight.  It was not the layout of her old house really, but of my cousin Stephanie's old house outside of Glens Falls.  All had been forgiven between Laura and me.  Rick and I walked along by the harbor on Shore Road.  We started walking on the far side closer to Andy Francino's house.  Soon we realized that the tide was higher than it had been most years-- the water was coming up to the road and depositing piles of marsh reed and blister-packs of seaweed on the street side of the rocks.  How would we walk from rock to rock?  I didn't think we could make it without getting wet but Rick hopped from rock to rock and I followed.    Somehow there was a sandy stetch of beach exposed down below the rocks closer to the water.  Some little kids started racing down the beach on ATVs, digging up the beach and eventually driving their wheels completely into sand.    I cae over to talk with the kids when they had been marshalled over to the rocks for a talking to. 
1024 20061010064009 pieces in finer things gallery kept breaking, including the more-tahn-life-size blue ceramic sculpture of an ape woman.  i tried ot find the cache of slides that would let me finish my last project before i left work.  i did find them eventually.  kim brooks and i looked outside on her deck that overlooked something and she reminded me of a book i had made a year ago.    my dad's uncle charley was visiting a strange house with two paths going through thick woods, scrambled by brush and leading through streams but still somehow inviting, but we did not venture in there before he got into his still idling vehicle (or perhaps a valet had started it for him?) because i did not have an anglish background, i felt it was within character to give my dad's uncle charley both a hug and a kiss.  at the same time i wanted to take two pieces of bread, toasted, from the back seat.  the alarm was a set of reins that you threw over birds  in lfight to harness yourself to them and fly in short staccato bursts. 
1028 20030714032607 My dreams all muddled--an ampitheater, disgruntled people in Untitled,  burnt out before the upcoming show.  Lunch with my sister in the glass  enclosed alcove by the front door.    In waking life, walking with Sarah early this morning, I ask, "Did we  talk recently about Dad braiding your hair each morning when he got you  ready for elementary school?"  "No," she said.  "I dreamed it then," I said, remembering how in my dream I had  explained how my dad, with his thick fingers with the thumbs made too  big from where he'd hit them with a hammer, putting up walls, had had  such a time getting my sisters' hair into pigtails and braids.  In my  dream my mother had laughed so hard, thinking of my sisters trotting  down the long driveway to the bus stop on the other side of the road,  one sister with one pigtail emerging just above her right ear and  another just above the center left of her head; the other sister with  two braids shooting off stray hairs in every direction, like an organic  firework. 
1029 20060108145608 We walked along on a trail through an area once civilized now returning to wilderness.  I was walking along big tree trunks worn smooth by years of travellers' footsteps.  Down below in the river was a concrete pathway that sometimes was submerged by muddy water.  That's where others wanted to walk.  Down in the river we were walking along the concrete path but then we came up and walked along the ridge.  I spotted a turtle attached to the underside of a branch so I picked him up.  But he was hibernating and did not wake up.  Then suddenly he woke with a start and I felt bad for disturbing his rest.  I looked for a good place to put him but he had been hanging upside down from a log and there was no way I could return him to that position.  Besides the outside had turned to a four-walled room, and there was furniture blocking all the places the turtle could crawl to reach the outside world.  Finally I moved the pink radiator away from the wall so the turtle could crawl behind it to the river below. 
1035 20030506102807 Rick's aunt Donna was on the phone at the same time that I was; I picked up the phone and she was yelling at Rick's uncle to kick out a woman, Betty, who was running an illegal coat warehouse shop out of the first story of the large building we were gathered in.  My family was all there with me, and I had made two pots of slurry-like food for them, but I had forgotten to make pasta to go along with it.  Nevertheless people were eating it.    Later, I was on the patio of a restaurant crowded with people.  Just an hour before the patio had been deserted.  I wanted to stretch but I felt self-conscious, and I thought about walking over to the grassy bank of the river.  Suddenly Casey Gill fro Untitled was talking with me.  We were talking about the rivers of water that had flowed down our driveways the night before; I was descrbing how great sheets of water had swept together midway up the driveway, how the water had caught and swirled at the edge of the street, how much I had wanted to slide around in it.   
1038 20061219093608 with les and lana, trying to find them some lunch somewhere around our studio.  tiffany dyer is there, helpful as always.  lana is on a special diet that allows her to only eat liquids.  i reason that we can go out for vietnamese.  there is a cracked egg held against my forehead -- there are crates of them, stacked ct farm fresh-style, preserved in huge four dozen-holding cardboard crates, but they are merely white inside, not mottled as some eggs preserved in shell are.  the other workers at ct, of which i am one, have these same eggs.  looking at the garden plot of organic vegetables, glimpsing the exposed heads of turnips and other winter root vegetables, bald pates peeking just out of the earth like autochthonous men, i realize there is one egg for every vegetable in this plot, one egg from who knows where in contrast to these vegetables which we know fro when they come.  there is a plow running through the earth that is the same as a speculum through my body.  i am holding the egg again to my forehead. 
1051 20060520120409 many a dream of the past three days in no particular order  my nan and I and another lady int he costume shop across from nes, buying wigs -- a black haired dreaded one and a longer lady gdiva one, one of each for both my nan and the other lady, for a costume ball to which they would go otherwise naked.  the lady godiva wig, my nan had been told, was necessary for the requisite fullness to cover herself.  the counter of the sales area was flimsy and about to fall apart.  the tiny praying mantis head was visible inside the barrel of the gun that was also a stapler.  i wanted to extract him but did not know how to do so without hurting or killing him.  rick looked up from his paper and announced " -- has the lodestone."  this somehow was equated with the point at the bottom of the pole in the firehouse, where an intricate compass rose had been painted.  inside this dim firehouse, searching for my way, i am drawn again and again to the compass.  i cannot schedule something for thursday because, i realize, i have a concert. 
1054 20031023105008 a train in the distance, or, don't eat a lot of brie and guava paste before bed   I dreamt a bus that hurtled down steep hills so fast my stomach flipped like it was on a roller coaster.  The driver kept looking back to talk to us, though I would have preferred he kept his eye on the road.  We were speeding down a hill that looked straight out of border town Mexico: the sky, land and buildings all the same grey and indeterminate brown.  We were poised to land directly in the middle of an intersection where a train was just now storming its way across the tracks, whistle blaring.    "Oh, that old lady," said the bus driver, talking about some crazy professor that would ride the bus every now and again.  "She's always worried about traffic coming in from that side."  He gestured to the right, where I saw for the first time that three separate streets worth of traffic were all converging and trying to merge into the lane in which we, thirty feet from the flashing warning gate of the train tracks, were still doing fifty-five.  
1072 20061004093020 we must drive very, very far to make it back to nashville and my cousins' visits before monday.  through the great megapolis of cincinnati and the wastleands of middle america.  man on a strange bike, why do you follow me?  we have to hand your red wagon through the slats of a wooden fence.  i have a certain idea of how i wish to parent a small child.  earlier int he 99-cent store, eating trail mix when i know i'm not supposed to.  the book club exercise to complete the square and find the hypotenuse of the triangle.  what relation this has to the argument of the book i am unsure but it is possible that the book, an otherwise uniteresting study of small town life, is written to encode this mathematical operation.  in any case i have missed the club discussion of this book, the mores and social phenomenon it discusses, he discussion held at nancy saturn's house on august 18th.  oprah, "like that fluent, sweet-tounged greek", had to overcome not only a speech impediment but a difficulty expressing herself verbally, though she was very smart. 
1073 20060505113808 05/03/06:  With my mom in a kitchen with walls of glass and one side completely open to the outside.  There in the trees in the dark outside were two small rufus owls.  When I spotted them in the tree sitting next to each other their round eyes opened wide and looked at me.  From out of the dark flew first one and then another snowy white owl.  They seemed at first to be flying toward the tree but then one flew towards me and settled with one claw on each of my shoulders, so that it was standing as if on a perch behind my head.  This made me both happy and nervouse, as though I had been chosen for a dangerous gift.  It did not hurt to have the owl on my shoulders but there was the possibility that it could sink its talons into me  mas ...  05/04/06:   ant's nest with the flying ants and large carpenter ants, burrowed into a whole in the wall in the midst of the dinner party with the too-cold salmon.  i spray an inexplicably present bottle of "flying ant" killer into it.  the room is dark and lit as though from inside the warm wood.  mas ...  
1091 20060511110608 11 may 06: party with wendy alexander, eric denton, others present.  it was our house but not.  soemthing was amiss but this only served to make everything funny.  i saw alison, rick's co-worker corey's fiancee, there.  she was fun to hang out with.  i saw alex briefly.  i realied that i missed hanging out and i felt bad that we had fallen out of touch.    yesterday (10 may 06) : when i was gardening with my mom and we struck underneath the long cedar log, border of the raised bed, with our shovels, we stirred up a large white worm.  but as i looked on we struck another, larger now, and i saw it as it emerged from the earth, gaining volume as it did so.  "a snake," my mom said.  "no," i said, "crocodillian" -- but the was another name i used for it that was more reflective of its ancient nature.  it chased me around the garden and i was filled with a primitive dread even though i knew that it was just a ghost of itself, ancient, and no real power to truly harm me.  it was white-pink and bloated and had dead glittery eyes like a dragon or a female box turtle.  
1094 20040701102207 The man going up the escalator did have the power to control reality with his mind, although his twin (separated from him at birth and only recently reunited) had told him he could not -- that their mother, a full-blooded whatever-it-was, could have transported herself to an energy portal just by thinking about it, but that this son could not. And indeed, for a while he would stand on the escalator going up and visualize himself going down -- upon which momentarily his direction would change and he would be gliding past people on the same escalator in the opposite direction -- but then the power of his thoughts would shift and he'd be riding the escalaor up again.  This battle went on fo several half-trips up and down the escalator until finally he summoned all his effort and descended to the basement of the department store, where, unbeknownst to the shoppers, a pathway to another dimension stood.  I had triple-booked myself to help three people with moving, and now I was not going to be able to help any one of them, because I was still laying in bed sleeping.  
1108 20031111092608 The long drive back from Montana--Rick driving all the way from Whitefish.  Looking through all the photos, taken formt he plane as well as from the ground--stretches of desert, mountains like a set of bowls laid out at a table, a terrain of craggy hills, rivers, lakes.    At the cabin meeting place, the door without a handle, the marble porch covered with a painter's dropcloth.  Explaining to Jenny and Casey Gill the emergent meaning of our tons of granola; comparing their move from French Canada when they were very small to my mother's move from Cortland when she was pregnant with twins.    My elementary school--a glass sliding door just inside the main hall, opening up into a playroom.  A little girl on the outside, laying on the floor refusing to join her parents.  I tried to convince her to go in. On the other side of the playroom, a classroom scene--I was trying to access a pile of old sweatshirts of my sister's so I could bring them into the playroom, where I had promised some friends I would provide them with long sleeves for the dodgeball game they were about to play.
1115 20060405110807 In a boarding hall in Europe somewhere, or was it London, I ran into some old friends from the States, friends I honestly had never expected to see again.  I almost borrowed clothes from them, from the hallway locker where they were stashed above Disney sound card books, all lined up in aphabetical order.  But I thought better of it at last and instead left a note in the locker with my thanks for the kind gesture of offering up the clothes.  I kept waking up and returning to this dream no matter how I tried to dream something else.   A large spider kept climbing toward me.  My mom was putting on foundation in the borading house bathroom.  She asked the beautiful middle-aged Russian lady, the chambermaid, for assistance.  I thought this was rude and I think the maid did too.  When my mom ran out the door after her with a tip, she was already gone, but a large woman with a great flaccid face with hundreds of fine wrinkles stood before us in her peach velour sweatsuit.  She was a ceramicist now living in this planned artists' community.  Kim's mom was asking me what days I would work.  
1123 20060601133208 -a variation of sudoku where one put the letter "B" in each box. the game was very simple, yet people enjoyed it because it was so soothing.  -story of the japanese woman, one of the most famous ladies ever, laying on her side with trumpet flowers growing out of her mouth. this is her method of gardening. what is important, she realizes, is the expression of her personal relationship to the flowers (?). this also involves hitting the snooze button on the alarm clock multiple times. each patch of seven minutes is another patch of ground within the garden and the woman must try to traverse it all.  -everyone in england at all times has had red hair and the coloring of most red-haired folk -- fair skin and soft eyes.  they are arrayed on a map of the united kingdom to show the complete permeation of this coloration in the region.  the ranges of red are very wide, from cinnamon to almost sandy to flaming -- but i am astonished to learn this fact now, becuase it is an indication of how genetically isolated england had been from the rest of europe, and how these traits have persisted to this day. 
1140 20060402135008 notes:  the television series of which i had only seen the launching episode, with the endearing young boy you knew was too good for the earth, as in victorian-era stories.  in this season's climax he was riding in the station wagon, seen only through the windshields clouded with rain and steam.  he had tubes attached to him and his head shaved.  he had a rare and untreatable, almost undiagnosable disease.  he was telling his borhters about what he saw in his dreams, whcih came more fast and frequent now and sometimes interfered with waking life (or what was left for him to call waking life).  in the dreams he was in a close place with four walls and a warm damp floor, and a close ceiling.  it was dark and red-brown but he was not scared because he had been there before. we see an image of this place and he is right, it is not scary: just -- unchanging.  a place people are held a while.  his brothers are scared but not him.  turning from the screen i talk with kate: perhaps it is his mother's womb?  and kate, replying, says that what it also is is the tomb.  these are essentially the same thing, we realize. 
1143 20031113090607 As I sped through the city of tomorrow--malls and sprawl everywhere, buildings gleaming white and silver in the sun--I realized I had missed the turn we had needed to take to get to an art supply store.  I pulled into the left lane only  to realize it was the on-ramp for the interstate--luckily, a small side road appeared, elevated high above several lanes of traffic.  I was driving the car erratically along a narrow strip of concrete lane, high abve the ground.  Danielle was with me, and we kept falling off the narrow walls of the rock-hewn precipice where we stood.  I nearly drove the car off, first, and then Danielle fell, back first, onto jagged rocks some thirty feet below--but she rolled into her fall and arrived on the ground tumbling and unhurt.  I dove after her, colliding with outcroppings, rolling over volcanic extrusions and jagged obsidian, until we both came to a point where the ground levelled off before sloping down some more.  We looked up to see that the whole cliff face was littered with bottles, gleaming in the sunlight.  "It's the birthplace of bottles, where bottles grow on trees," I said.
1159 20031224112007 We were constructing an endless type of cut-up  ghazal , using as our matla any number of lines from Shakespeare's poetry and plays.  In subsequent lines we would repeat one phrase of Shakespeare's and rapid-fire couple it with our own, continuing in this manner near breathlessly and almost indefinitely, as though we were playing an Elizabethan version of  the dozens .   This whole process was possible only in early morning, when the light came in golden-green and silver-blue through the bare ruined choirs of grey trees.  And our lines from Shakespeare, too, had to make reference to light or morning or at very least to the out-of-doors.    As my mom woke us up to see, in real life, a rainbow that arced above the end of our driveway into the woods across the street, I barely had time in my dream to say these lines:  Dim that verse, and dim that way And dim those eyes, the break of day  Then in real life we stood outside, my dad in his boxers and my sister and I without any shoes, and looked at the rainbow as it faded into the silky blue of the western sky, behind us the eastern woods glowing as though dipped in honey or amber. 
1162 20060205155408 Woke up screaming twice because Kate on the phone kept telling me Sarah had=  died.  On the streets of New York I tried to convince doctors telepathical= ly to bring her back to life.  At some Brooklyn family member's house, with=  the raised flocked wallpaper and the heavy wooden furniture, sitting at th= e table with its pad to prevent stains and heat marks, the filmy yellow-ora= nge light of seventies photos suffusing everything, talking with my Aunt Fa= nny and the thrid, unknown sister, in English and colloquial Italian, reali= zing that she was not backwards as everyone had suspected, but that no one = had ever spoken her language.  Later walking with her past those New York C= ity streets she'd never been able to walk alone, passing by the street corn= er where hundreds of cats gathered.  Some owners trained their cats to stan= d on the ir hindlegs to greet their children when they got off school and c= ame through the park, and some cats ont heir hindlegs even wore long belted=  jackets and carried hand bags to accentuate their resemblance to fancy Edw= ardian ladies.  How my Aunt Fanny and I loved to see these animals.  
1168 20061116063209 in the cavernous stairway lit by fluorescent lights, the wind was so strong htat the fans were bent in strange directions, were lowering.  my mom, but it was kim brooks really, accompanied by rachel ray, who was the interor design consultant, pulled out the mortared-in beams at the far end of the room.  it was hard-to-tell at first, but i realized the house was leaning.  the whole house would fall eventually because this point of support had been removed.  when we told my dad he siad, "finally, to get out of this house".  he went upstairs to look and said "of course! how could one not know.  but i had thought it was only fifteen degrees (of tilt that the beam created)".  i went downstairs to my sisters to gather upt he things we wanted to take with us.  for me, my viola of course, and childhood books -- we found my mother's secret treasure of rock and journals and other such things.  we could not find mitsumiso anno's "magical midnight circus" book.  i was walking up a paved hill alone -- not alone, but with other strangers behind me -- when i realized i needed to go back to watch the house fall.  i had a letter ineeded to deliver.    
1175 20030326083007 We were driving through the night to Memphis--long stretches of back roads, lit only by headlights.  We had a baby in the car with us--my cousin's baby, Parker.  We'd taken it and forgotten to let them know we were taking it.  Actually, when we'd picked it up we thought we would be meeting my cousin and her husband in Memphis; we'd just picked the baby up off the floor because no one was home.  But upon closer consideration, once we were about an hour-and-a-half out of town, we realized that they might get anxious because their baby was missing, and decide not to come to Memphis at all.  I kept looking for my cousin's number, trying to remember it.  I kept all my numbers in my palm pilot and I'd left it at home, or so I thought.   We stopped off in an HEB-style grcoery store--lots of fresh, tropical fruits--and I realized that my palm pilot was in my knapsack's front pocket. But I still couldn't get in touch with my cousin.  We hadn't gotten to Memphis, where we were going to pick up some members of my family, but I figured we should just turn around and drive back to Nashville to drop off the baby.  It would be four a.m. before we got in.   
1178 20030723083807 The weather was unseasonably cool.  I was sitting on a wooden deck with a bunch of other folks.  We had been putting away some of the different types of chairs and tables that had been stacked up on the deck for winter storage.  Now it was summer, and time to take them down.  But it was so cold I had to go inside and grab a down comfoter to wear around me.  In my upstate grandma's house, I kept searching for my dad: he kept pulling out old prints and old blocks to show me.  Danielle and I were walking through a city; we came at last to a bus and train terminal, a vast underground city.  We met up with the principal of the school that Danielle was taking on a field trip the next day. The principal gave me a map one of her second graders had drawn.  Using the map, I was supposed to navigate my way to the park we would be exploring on our field trip.  I would be responsible for a group of kids, including the little girl who had drawn the hard-to-read map.  The principal left and Danielle and I walked out the massive glass and steel doors--sixty feet high--of the terminal.  Night had fallen, and we were walking down side alleys talking about love.  
1179 20030625221407 Going in to the darkened H.E.B.--the shopping mall at the bottom of the hill, like a ceramic castle at the bottom of a fishbowl, the same in all my dreams.  In the produce aisle as I realized that the store was closing--I was grabbing the last of my twelve greenish sprouting potatoes and getting in line.    At the front of the store several people were still checking out.  I was buying some sort of raffle tickets as well.  Jenny and Casey Gill were in front of me, and after they had checked out and left the store the cashier and I realized that Casey had forgotten her pink furry purse.  Outside in the parking lot I was looking for Casey and her sister's 1965 superhero-style car, all elongated contour and low roof.  It was threatening to rain--the sky was lime green, bright pink, baby blue as though at sunset, but the colors stretched erratically across the sky like a slow motion aurora borealis.  Dark clouds were gathering everywhere, boiling at the edges of the sky.  At my car, as the rain poured down, I realized I'd left the windows open.  Absurd amounts of rain were pouring into my car, as though a culvert emptied into my driver's side seat.  
1186 20030824105608 My parents and I were searching for a breakfast nook where all the rest of our coterie had gone.  We found a touristy shop, filled with gag gifts and outlandishly-priced coffee drinks.  Later on, the same shop became a place to make cheap photocopies.  I opened up a video game--it featured the hand of God returning to bring children's souls to salvation.  The game's catch was that you couldn't be assured of salvation--you had to come to the edge of dying to determine if you would be saved.  The screen was larger than life so all the characters were accurately-sized.   Rick and I had been invited somewhere for Easter but Rick didn't want to go for fear of running into people he didn't want to see.  We were walking through a mound of rubble: the remains of the General Post Office in Dublin after the  Easter Rising .  I had taken up running again.  It was winter and I was running through Rick's dad's neighborhood.  Only his mom lived in the house where his dad once had--but she was still at work when I passed by, glimpsing the open front door.  I was going to put down the credit card, the apple, and the cell phone that I inexplicably was carrying with me. 
1191 20030306070607 In my dreams everything was dark; it was night perpetually and I stumbled around in darkness.  First I walking around a circular tower with my Aunt Maddy--we had come, I think, from a large gathering of my family.  I was several steps ahead of my Aunt Maddy and at one point, just out of her sight.  Somehwere far off an orchestra was playing the opening to "Rite of Spring", except it had been re-written for clarinet, English horn and something resembling Andean flute.  I was dancing by myself in the landing of the tower.  Sometime later, we were in Lana's house, but not really.  Again, it was dark, as though the house had been put away for the night.  Lana had finished up with the dishes but I had a few more I needed to washaway--upstairs, I'd discovered a big mess in the arts and crafts room, and I had some things I had to wash up from there.  I couldn't find the soap at first--then I spotted it.  Then I was looking for copper cleaner because the samovar I was washing loooked like it needed some shining.  But Lana didn't have any.     It was still dark, and I was in a dingy old storefront, putting away type.  That was our business--"We put away your type."  
1193 20030701005408 dream of 6/30  Walking through the alley of vendors, first outside, then in, with my mom and my Aunt Gin.  Trying on the funny straw hat with the purple flowers while the woman draped a piece of purple chiffon around my neck.  In the cafeteria, opening all the doors to bring in the breeze from the sudden storm, outside.  My grandpa alive once more, a man made out of wax.  His living room was filled with wall-mounted wooden carrying cases somehow akin to the stands in auto parts stores, with all the recommended parts for various makes and models of cars.  Inside each box were about a hundred pamphlets inside manila envelopes about 4 by 7 inches.  Inside the pamphlets were detailed instructions on how to fix every wiring, electrical, plumbing or household repair problem.  My grandpa was going to throw them away because he figured he was the only person smart enough to bother to consult them, even though his sons, my dad and my uncle, were trying to convince him otherwise.  I was so angry with my grandfather, and the way he still made my father feel small.  Even though, in my dream, I recognized that it was nearly impossible to be angry at a man made out of wax. 
1197 20060113201408 Leaving for a moment the Bradley family group portrait session, and the discussion of how each year the same gifts were apportioned and divvyed out, through blind drawing of slips of paper which held the written-out descriptions of the wished-for items, I came upon a busy street.  There was my childhood friend Mike Wells standing at the edge of a traffic island in the middle of the road.  In front of him there was a triangular building  with a payphone on its edge.  But if you hear Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris sing together doesn't it make you cry? I said.  Then there she was, Emmylou, walking down the street toward us, and though her hair was grey and smartly bobbed the sunlight followed after her like in those movies from the seventies.  I felt like a child.  For some reason Mike had introduced us as nursing students and part-time nurses and she very graciously commended us on pursuing that calling.  She recommend several movies to us, writng down one on a scrap of paper: "Gomer Pyle" or "Alphonese Richter" (Gerhard Richter?).  But I was trying to figure out what Emmylou was listening to these days as I thought it would be something I should listen to also.  
1201 20030201111607 History Repeats the Old Conceits   I can't remember my dreams from last night.  They were in three distinct stages--2:30 - 7, 7-9:30, 9:30-10:30.  Of the 2:30-7:00 section all that remains is vague shadows of people gathered in a building.  I remember a fragment of the 7-9:30 section where I was walking around at night.  Most recently, just before I woke up, I was standing next to another woman admiring some cave paintings on a wall.  They were very ancient, or so I thought--yet there were modern-looking preparatory sketches for them hung up on the wall next to them.  The four sketches were small, about 5"x7" each, and each of them was framed in a brightly colored wooden frame that picked up the colors in the sketch.  One of them in particular, the one in the lower left hand corner, was very beautiful; it looked like a combination of pen and ink, lithography and engraving.  It was mainly in black and white and had several small but elongated figures standing on a hillside.  It looked kind of like a   Leonard Baskin  engraving, but in some way--the loose ink strokes, maybe--it reminded me of   Don Quixote   by Picasso.  I was looking at it more closely when I woke up. 
1201 20030327085407 At a public school, I was trailing on the heels of Ms. Susa's class.  Ms. Susa, in her linen capri pants and straw hat, was leading her class throgh a courtyard--she was making them complete her sentences. At the other end of the courtyard, underneath a covered awning, classes were assembling, perhaps returning from recess.  Their teachers were picking them up.  Mrs. Sobik was at the head of her class, and she nodded in recognition when she saw me.  The old men from orchestra--Claude the violist and dear ninety-year-old Dr. Tarpley--were throwing up their keys on to the roof and having them slide down the slanted overhang.  They kept falling to the ground--a few shots went over the awning's apex and fell tot he other side.  Finally I grabbed the set of keys before they fell to the ground.  I hid them in a sweatshirt and carried them before me, away from the courtyard.  I was cleaning off a dune buggy; my student Jeli was at my side.  Dusk was falling, and then swift night.  I was trying to have her practice various gross motor skills by showing her different ways to use the sponge to clean off various parts of the dune buggy--a la Mr. Miyagi in   The Karate Kid  .    
1213 20060130121007 When I played viola, sitting in the elementary classroom, Laura Sobik sitting next to me, I missed the little solo I was supposed to play as I was not counting correctly.  I looked at the line of music, but as I sometimes do when reading, I took in the meaning of the whole page at once without looking at the individual notes, which was necessary for this piece.  I was trying to play by just listening to what Laura was doing.  Allison Macholz called me out on it, and the conductor called on the other string instruments (first and second violin and cello) to play their solo parts, whcih joined together with mine to forma little quartet.  Dale Conway and Rick were sitting at the dining room table at my Nanny and Pop-Pop's old house, going over Plowhaus documents and waiting to talk with me.  There were stacks of children's thank you letters to Franne Lee, some addressed as though in error to "Grace", almost all mis-stating the name of Plowhaus - "Play Palace", "Play House".  Reveiwing the letters, I was struck by the need for an efficient commuter rail system to bring people to different parts of the city.  Amy Weidner selling cheap beaded and imitation Savorski-crystalled watches. 
1222 20030624085207 My dad was looking for his Vidal Sassoon strawberry blond highlights shampoo.  My sisters and mom and grandmothers and I were sitting around our kitchen table here in Nashville.  Kate went off to shower and get ready for some big family function.  We were going to have to go to church; it would be cold inside the cathedral.  It was cold, bleak November, and for some reason I felt it would be a good idea to dress as I might have dressed back in seventh grade--that is, badly.  Outside on a grassy knoll, I ran to my sister Sarah and convinced her she needed to come with me.  The sun was setting, a red pit of embers in the west.  She didn't realize it, but we would be running to our destination.  I looked at her shoes and realized she wasn't dressed properly.    "Sarah," I said, "did you know that we're running there?"  She didn't, but she said it was okay.  We were running down country roads at dusk on the shortest day of the year; the air was stangely warm.  We were running to a shopping mall; we needed to get to a nighclub to see if our friends were inside.  My sister looked young, just barely fifteen.  I had forgotten to put my i.d. in my pcket.  The man at the door let us throuh anyway. 
1228 20030410082808 I was hiding in the brush outside a concrete building--a parking lot or  a bleak college lecture hall.  I was going to surprise Rick and  Brandon , but suddenly I realized that I was crouching down in what could be poison ivy.  Orange and black bugs that  looked like flattened caterpillars or non-hairy centipedes were crawling  over me and biting me.  Rick and Brandon were pulling me out, but I  actually woke up trying to brush off the stinging centipedes.  Later on, I was in the musical practice rooms from my high school.  I  had missed a lot of school for my grandfather's funeral, and I was  trying to figure out how I would make up all the work I had missed-- particularly my math class, which I kept skipping. I couldn't remember  what I was studying in any of my classes, but I knew that I would have  to miss Friday and therefore would have to take a bunch of tests in  various classes tomorrow, Thursday.  In one practice room, keyboards lay shrouded like bodies on the floor  beneath white sheets.  Different groups were practicing in corners.  One  young girl and her old matron of a teacher were practicing Coltrane  songs on tenor saxophones, precariously straddling a nine foot long  keyboard. 
1228 20031220030008 jesus, you ain't no pimp, dude   I dreamt I was trying to show someone, maybe my dad,  the Fensler Film remakes of the GI Joe public service announcements .  I was so excited because I had finally located them on the vast expanses of the in-tar-net.   The PSA began with a broad pan of a snowy forest hill.  "Oh, it's the skier one," I said out loud.  "This one's hysterical."  But an Indian-American girl emerged, skating down the hill on her boots, and I knew something was amiss.  I had somehow stumbled onto the pc version of the  skier service announcement , put out by a Christian Youth organization.  "Look at me, guys," the girl said as she slipped downhill onto ice. "I'm totally going really fast!"  Then--as she skidded out onto the ice, falling flat on her face--"Shoot!"   Her friends, following close behind, shouted vague and ineffective words of positive encouragement.  A red-headed parka-wearing man emerged on skis, asking, "What are you children doing trespassing on my property?"  The crisis was resolved, with lots of pithy homilies on loving one's neighbors and respecting the differently-abled.  Then at the end, all the children sang "Jesus Christ" just as they would have sang "GI Joe". 
1241 20060127101808 Will and Christine had asked me to read a poem at their wedding.  I had written one or found one, I can't remember which, but it was eight stanzas of four lines each, and talked about a person going into the Underworld to reclaim a lost love or his lost self.  I was reading it out loud to make sure I had gotten the meter right.  There were the three white leaves of a poinsettia splayed on a branch at odd angles.  I was going to wear these in my hair, but as I put them on the branch drooped down and one of the leaves covered up my right eye.  Carri Hofaker appeared and we were having a pillow fight with large couch cushions.  We were drinking tea and chatting when I realized exactly how late it was.  I ran out the door with my poem on the piece of paper.  Though earlier I had passed by the reception hall, in a quiet street in the middle of a city, now the setting was downtown Port Jefferson, just along the water by the ferry.  I was running across the street by the t-intersection, looking at a clock that was just as fast as the clock in the Malibu: two hours and forty-six minutes.  Since it said 9:00, I knew that I was fourteen minutes late.  The ceremony started at 6 p.m. and they would be waiting for me.  
1261 20031207040407 The long walk-- in my bare feet, or so I realized, once I had walked past the stagnant marshes and through the forests, all the way to New Haven and its turrets and parapets of docks and bridges.  Walking, now with sneakers on, past Filipino restaurants, the crazy waitress outside the Mexican restaurant, her big beautiful hair shining in the sunlight glistening off the water.  Everywhere people congregating as though for a church revival.  Hot pants had come into style again, and in my head I said to myself, "Truly the fashions of the early 90s returneth." Katherine Dunn was talking to me about teaching and living.    Outside our house in Nashville I was making plans to meet with Alina outside Atlanta; and in my mind our house existed simultaneously in Georgia and Tennessee.  We were going to meet at a beautiful park but the fear of Japanese fox-spirits prevented us.    Brandon had changed the colors of his website, and the layout, to a beautiful red mud brown and cornflower blue, in the style of a landscape laid out in Japanese pottery.  He had posted two lines of a poem that made sad, because I saw them as dismissive of me, but rightfully so. Then, inexplicably, I received an email about a memorial service for Eliott Smith. 
1283 20060409084607 Our project was to make a Rube Goldberg-like machine that would keep an egg in nearly perpetual motion for as long as possible; or rather, to move the egg in as many different directions for equivalent distances as possible.  Our contraption shot the egg up very high along a slide-like portion of our machine; then it came down with enough velocity to shoot across the room, hit a liitle ramp at the top of an angled-up jump, and come back down.  I looked at the set-up carefully, and pronounced solenly, well, if we have four parts of the apparatus completed, we must strive for five."  Our advisor, a charming, frizzy-haired lady from Japan, was talking about waht we might do to get more velocity as the egg came off the smaller ramp. I thought I might put folded up cloths over the ramp to make the surface bigger but the woman suggested these metal plates that we were not able to attach with anything, just place.  I was sitting at the table with Kate's childhood self and others, trying not to laugh as both Kate and I ate the flesh off giant rinds of pink grapefruit that were turned nearly inside out.  At the end most strongly my head was singing to myself a song that mixed together B & S's "Seymour Stein" and Jacques Brel's "No, Love, You're Not Alone". 
1302 20030619091207 In a park with my sister Kate--people of all nationalities were walking to and fro, sitting in the grass eating picnic suppers, walking along a quasi-boardwalk (without any ocean beyond it) and ducking into coffee shops, cafes, and souvenir shops.  We'd just narrowly escaped an enormous storm.  It was sweeping through the park; it had hit Bryce's shop, too, with a torrent of wind and rain.  Kate and I were no longer walking; we were driving, now, but I was having difficulty knowing just how fast I should drive because all the speed limit signs were in  metric ,  I didn't want to get another ticket.  Before we had gotten in the car, though (a strange Fred Flinstone/maglev sort of affair--we weren't actually enclosed in any device, just floating), my sister went over to where a Jamaican sounding man had been dvertising his end-of-the-night cafe specials.  When we got there the shop was closed, although we could walk right up to the front counter and through the dark maze of stacked tables and chairs.  Somebody confided, "That isn't his real accent, you know.  He just fakes it for the business."  Kate confided that she wasn't moving down to Nashville, but I'd known that already.  Earlier, Ms. Garcia from my old school was forcing us all to watch bad children's movies. 
1314 20031121000007 Earlier Mat Daly was searching for a gay bar called "joi".  I had dragged our long corded phone outside to the edge of a shed so that I could call someone I wasn't supposed to and convince him not to call me anymore.  I was late to an orchestra performance--late to our warm-up at the edge of a curtained stage, late getting back from the bathroom, where I had gone to switch out of my day clothes into the white top and black pants we were required to wear.  When I and the others who had gone back there with me--we had all had to change and hadn't had time to do so--the concert had begun.  I walked onto stage during what I thought was a break--it was merely a dramatic pause, and the music resumed before I could take my seat.  Stephanie Vandermeer, the oboeist, sitting at the edge of the violins, moved over so that I could at least sit with the strings.    Later, rolling first into a box that seemed like an oversized coffin, then across a mat in an effort to efficiently film a commercial.  My cousin Samm was behind a heavy velvet curtain, showing me seeds she had won, to be planted by April 2004.  She had found something else, a piece of ancient technology.  On the map before my feet, a discussion about bringing a wendigo-like bird across the nearby border into a Canadian province. 
1316 20060114123608 In my parents' home.  I was trying to hard boil eggs that had already been sliced into quarters and halves.  No one knew how long they should cook.  My mom suggested twenty minutes.  "But they're already cooked," I said, checking the Joy of Cooking, now with a new red cloth cover, for advice.  "Harry" had purchased some antique long rifle, perhaps from my dad.  It had pearl embellishments on a polished and engraved red cherry wood frame.  He was having it shipped to Oregon.  This made my dad mad.  Aunt Kathy was sitting at the table and, gesticulating wildly, spilled coffee on herself.  Aunt Doreen got up from where she was sitting by the window and took Andy Beckey outside to have a discussion, as he was the only potential suitor of my sister Sarah that she could tolerate.  Who was the third suitor?  I could not remember.  My Uncle Joe moving cars around - having Andy first move the white neon to the side, then Joe himself backing up the malibu into the side yard of my parents' house.  My Aunt Barbara walking down our driveway to Chuck's house, where she now lived.  Her two daughters walked with her -- they looked like Beth Gilmore's or Sunny Becks' daughters -- one about middle school age, the other still a young elementary school student, all three dressed in virgin Mary blue. 
1323 20060417232407 Vivek Krishna had kindly taken my viola to the stage of our elementary school cafetorium, where Dr. C would lead us in a performance of a movement from Debussy's  Pelleas et Melisande .  I hurried from the back, where permanent auditorium chairs had been installed and various folks from Nashville's performing arts groups were seated.  I thanked Vivek as I took my instrument from him, but I was worried that I had fogotten his name, calling him instead by his brother's, Vinay (which I had not).  As I took my seat I realized that I did not knwo what we were playing.  I looked around and my stand partner finally whispered "Pelleas".  But I stared absently at the pages, which were all labelled with the English translations of the various sections.  Finally, he whispered again, annoyed, "Pain".  Indeed, there was the section labelled "Pain" right on the page, beneath "Danse de les Amours".  My stand partner glared at me as we stood outside.  "How many rehearsals have you made this year anyway?" he asked.  "Two or three?"  "Believe it or not, I think I've made seventy percent," I said, amazed myself that it was that high a figure.  The day was sunny and bright, golden midday sun shining through the light canopy of vines to our right, and directly onto the brick walled courtyard where we stood. 
1326 20030325093807 I had to try on a bunch of clothes from my upstate Grandma, but few of them fit just right.   Two boys about fourteen or fifteen were gathered around my Nanny's piano from her old house.  They were part of a pop group that I thought was from Bohemia (the one in Europe, not the one on L.I.), but they kept talking to each other in French.  Finally they started talking in Russian.  "Ya govoryu ochen ploha," one said to the other.  "Pa angliski?" I asked, and he said yes.  There was something strange about them: they were wearing old-fashioned clothes, and I had heard that they had just come off a boat from somewhere.  I was going to have to sing "Amazing Grace" for a family gathering.  I was running around a street I'd never been on, looking for something--music, perhaps, but I also needed to find the back room of my Nanny's old house.  In one shady lawn, there was a set of monkey bars about seven feet above my head.  I tried reaching for them, reasoning that if I were destined to sing "Amazing Grace" perhaps I was destined to climb these monkey bars.  But I couldn't reach them. Sour grapes--it turned out to be a good thing.  As I watched, parts of the bars drooped lower until I could see that they were actually stiffened power lines, cracked in some places to expose hundreds of frayed wires. 
1333 20030213042007 Jikishi-ninshin   I keep waking up from the dreams I have in the middle of the night, waking bolt upright out of bed and needing to walk around for a while to convinve myself I am awake and not dreaming.  For the most part the dreams I wake from are not that earth-shattering.  Just now for example I was dreaming that I was in my bed.  I was seeing myself in the bed and everything was fire-red and smoky.  In fact, I was seeing not myself but the shadow I made on the wall. (Oh duh, now this seems really silly.)  The thing giving off all the light, heat (for it was warm), and smoke was, bizzarely enough, the liquid slurry with which you make paper.  I was going to make paper and somehow it was going to allow me to see myself, not just my shadow.  The odd thing about this realization was just that: it was a realization that encompassed all my senses.  As I stared at my shadow, the words came into my mind as you might experience giant words, inscribed in stone on the base of a monument, that you read and heard aloud and rubbed your fingers across simultaneously.  I grasped their sense utterly and immediately, as though they were written on a tablet that had been placed before my eyes and read all at once in a single tone.  When I woke bolt upright, the thing that came to mind was the  Flower Sermon .  
1336 20060409083208 Our project was to make a Rube Goldberg-like machine that would keep an egg in nearly perpetual motion for as long as possible; or rather, to move the egg in as many different directions for equivalent distances as possible.  Our contraption shot the egg up very high along a slide-like portion of our machine; then it came down with enough velocity to shoot across the room, hit a liitle ramp at the top of an angled-up jump, and come back down.  I looked at the set-up carefully, and pronounced solenly, well, if we have four parts of the apparatus completed, we must strive for five."  Our advisor, a charming, frizzy-haired lady from Japan, was talking about waht we might do to get more velocity as the egg came off the smaller ramp. I thought I might put folded up cloths over the ramp to make the surface bigger but the woman suggested these metal plates that we were not able to attach with anything, just place.  I was sitting at hte table with Kate's childhood self and others, trying not to laugh as both Kate and I ate the flesh off giant rinds of pink grapefruit that were turned nearly inside out.  At the end most strongly my head was singing to myself a song that mixed together B & S's "Seymour Stein" and Jacques Brel's "No, Love, You're Not Alone" (just the part about catching the sea in shells).     
1338 20060131083208 Map with aerial view of the early European immigrants to each state.  Those in were beautiful Irish folk with pale skin and flaming red curly hair.  Panning to Kentucky one saw, gathered for a feast day, their dark haired dark-eyed counterparts, also from Ireland but from the wilds farther north, along hte coast.  And they were wilder and more savage and perhaps more lovely.   But there was another gathering, this one for a Norwegian fest day, and all of the children were blond haired and blue-eyed with fair, almost golden skin.  And they rode in to the crowd on horses with plumes on their head as in the circus.  The children, some as small as six months, would ride several kids to a horse, strapped in with fabric belts kind of like the fastening straps for the car-top carrier.   Riding in was one woman with a Dutch boy page, natural shining blond. She had enormous eyes that, when you looked at them from the side, had a tiny straight tube coming out from them, each right in the center of her pupil.  SHe was telling fof her work in the hynoptists research artist, how we would stretch his eyes open wide and try to tell his yound patients with him mind to select certain images from a grid of four.    "Why couldn't he just use eye movements to do this?" I asked and she launched into a long explanation.   
1347 20060317094408 Someone discussing what they termed the "BOOM-chick-chick" and the "BOOM-chick-BOOM-chick" rhythms of Mozart's second and third movements ofthe Jupiter Symphony.  We were all -- Tiffany and Sam and me (and some mysterious fourth: Erika?) drawn by the packages of Life Savers wintermint rings that had been discarded in front of someone's trash.  So we went over to see if we could grab some.  On our way back, looking in ground floor windows of urban flats, with their feeling of London in the time before the world wars, the unshaded lightbulb and the plaster cracking on the walls.   Back at the pub there was a very large group of us.  Some other people before had asked us all what we did and why there was such a big group of us together.  We were a group not unlike Mark's kollektiv, and we were meeting together to decideour next steps -- how we would divvy up jobs, use a space we hadrecently acquired.  The people at the next table over wanted to finance us but wanted to know more about us first.  I was introducing people but there came a point where I didn't even know the people on the end that well, so they started introducing themselves.  Many of the people at the table next to us who had wanted to find out more about us had to leave to catch a plane but some stuck around, wanting to hear us all the way through. 
1356 20030503231807 The Egotist Considers   I don't remember my dream from this morning.  That said, I will qualify what follows with this --I often hallucinate when I am very tired. Once, when driving from Houston to the Rio Grande Valley in the middle of the night, I spotted fifteen-foot tall horses on their hind legs, dressed in Confederate uniforms and picking cotton in a stubbly field by the side of the road.  I was really disturbed until I realized that it wasn't actually real.  Then I was still disturbed, but only because I was seeing things.  However, I did have a bizarre vision as I sat out on the front porch with some friends last night.  It was about four-thirty in the morning.  I was sitting on the edge of the steps.  My friend Molly was sitting next to me but about a foot closer to the door, and my friend  Brandon  was sitting just next to the rightmost pillar on our porch.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a man in a wide-rimmed shallow straw hat emerge from the corner of the house, pass behind Brandon, and disappear behind the pillar.  The man was wearing a checked shirt of flannel.  He was clean-shaven, with a bit of sandy-colored stubble, a broad and slightly simian face, and furtive eyes.  He was probably about five foot ten.  He looked like my image of the ghost of Peter Quint from  The Turn of the Screw .    Carry on.

1361 20060611165607 At our house.  It was grey afternoon; Kate was over and we were getting ready to go on a long, long journey, perhaps never to return?  There was a ring at the doorbell.  I looked outside to see Bad People in the streets.  One was a t our door pretending to be a serviceman or delivery person but the other people were scoping out the back door, windows, etc. so they could figure out ways to get into the house.  I locked the door against the guy out front, trying not to let him see me, though he already knew we were inside.  Then I tried to make sure all the entrances to the house were secured but I couldn't go downstairs to the basement to make sure both those doors were secured (the second interior door could not be secured anyway).  When I came back through the living room I was horrified to find one of the bad people stretched out on the floor in the passageway into the hallway leading up to the stairwell.  I was on the floor next to him and suddenly I realized I loved him.  I still thought he was evil and wanted to harm me but I blurted out that I loved him and I was surprised to hear him say the same thing.  "I think you're adorable," he said, and I thought that was strange.  He was a soldier and was going off to fight a war.  I would go with him.  We got up and left the house.  It would be a long long journey on foot.   
1363 20030426013008 dream of April 25   The infinite school bus ride--to turn around and see Debbie Iberger. A boring person is talking. The harbor is filled with sunken grills.  Bryce's enormous new warehouse studio, very trendy, with a bar at the entryway. A party w/bartender--the staff behind the bar have come up with lots of idead for the non-profit community print shop.  Farmer Matthew is there with a list.  The sad feeling of being replaced.  Bryce is making posters--a silhouette in red spray paint with red lines behind, on knotty pine. The stencil faces--a crowd of profiles silhouetted in black.  Someone a la Mary Carol is asking, "Did they rent out the bathroom from my parents?"  The answer is no.  Preserved mango--I give my friend Doriet one, a thin dried slice, when I meet her on the winding stair.  She is still in Teach for America and she doesn't have time to talk, but she will speak to me later, she says.  She will make a "jew necklace" out of the mango, she tells me, as she clutches it to her chest.  Something that should have been refrigerated--the entire milk and cheese section of Kroger's, all closed down.  The three remaining gallon containers of 2% milk had been frozen--now they are defrosting into large clumps of ice milk and pools of cloudy liquid.  There is a bucket of ice feeble in the room temperature refrigerator case.   
1365 20060413082408 Through the sliding glass window I could see the herd of wild dogs running: they had bridles on them and their heads were disproportionately large, with square muzzles and short, coarse brown hair that made them look like early carnivorous mammals.  They had one long row of vicious pointy teeth that reached all the way to the back of their jaw.  They occassionally stood up on their hind legs and ran that way for a while.  I called my dad's attention to them and asked if it was true that the people down the street kept this pack of animals.  "Yes, he's breeding them to pickle them," my dad said.  As I looked more closely it seemed that the animals were a long-lost marsupial carnivore from Australia.  Horses began to run around the circular paddock as well.    Wallis Simpson leaned over my ear and began reciting her verse. Many of her poems were about what she had given up to become a wife -- not specifically the wife of Edward VIII, but a wife in general.  But it was her other poems that were more interesting: the poem in which she talked about the color of the sea, for instance:  If it is blue, it is not the blue   Tinged by green and dazzled by the sun  But the blue of the depths  Fathomless    If it is yellow, it is not the yellow  Measured out in tea-cups  In parlors on Sunday afternoons,  Nor mixed with blue to make green.  
1367 20030317113608 The little kid who kept wandering onto the railroad tracks was supposed to have been picked up hours ago.  The kindergarten wing I had known in elementary school was superimposed onto the corner of town where Bryce's shop is located.  Instead of only one set of tracks, however, there were four, two on each direction of a sharply pointed x.  We--mainly students from my high school--were going to go away for two days to a tropical paradise.  I'd forgotten to say goodbye to my dad. Someone was solving arithmetic problems using ridiculous mnemonics and "tricks."  I'd stepped on a train to get some item and became trapped on it as it began departing.  Students from the Preschool Program for Children with Disabilities were on the train, going home.  Mrs. Trevino, the computer room aide, was asking me to pick up some materials since I would be coming back in to teach in her classroom.  I knew they were Christian materials and wasn't sure why I needed them.   I'd asked Mrs. Gonzalez to hold my bus, Bus D, for me.  It was still waiting.  I had some hard candy in my mouth; I kept trying to talk with  the bus driver, to thank him for waiting, but all that would come out was drool and mumbles.  The bad kids from my early childhood bus riding experience were there: Carl Weinfeld was standing otside the bus, lighting sheets of fabric on fire.  
1367 20060112074407 The dream I would record when I woke up inside my dream from my dream-within-a-dream: James Joyce's  Ulysses  set on the streets of New York City rather than Dublin and styled in the manner of a Choose Your Own Adventure, not so much in the sense of alternate endings but in the style of narration, which was all second person, a dizzying aspect ofthe story which I did not notice until midway through.  But when I checked back in the book to confirm it I had been reading "You" all along.  Daedelus / your / one's adventures in the NYC of the Beat Generation.  An Edwardian man in a factory office extending an offer of marriage to a beautiful young girl but as he does so the warning signs that marriage is not for him appear (harpies, personified lingam/yonis, the like).  The sterotypical and offensive graphic of two Native Americans, Flathead and Whiteface, walking in the rain, the tall one (Flathead) holding up an umbrella that hewalked under, trailing behind him on a chain or rope Whiteface, who hunched over like Neanderthal man, walked in the rain.  But there was a third, otherwise invisible, that also walked always besides them, also in the rain, through barren land they had been sent to.  Then in my dream awake, speeding down the road with Rick at the wheel remembering Long Island, speeding toward 8 a.m. and needing to go to work. 
1370 20030910075407 9/9 I glimpsed Dana Lukin, Vinay Krishna, and Glenn Barnes standing on rickety wet scaffolding that stood, freestanding, in the middle of a field.  I notice that Dana had swung himseld around the the outside of the scaffolding and was trying to scale the slippery wet metal rods.  "Don't--" I cautioned, but he just waved us away with a smile.  Then his fingers suddenly slipped, he lost his grip, and for a moment teetered and swayed as though he would regain his balance and his grasp.   But horribly his body contorted as though for a moment he leaned back onto a pillar of air--then he fell swiftly and at right angles until he collapsed in a broken pile on the ground.    There was a Mexican lunch spread out somewhere along the grounds.  I had been walking a beautiful dog, very intelligent but very large an curious.  It nearly bowled over every other dog we would see, it was so inteesting in sniffing it.   I dreamt an amalgam of the story of Aeneas, Medea, and Oedipus/Jacosta. In my dream, the hero, Aeneas, had married his mother and Medea simultaneously.  He had just found out that he had killed his own father and married his own mom, and Medea was about to kill him and herself.  9/10 All I can remember is the supermarket themed dream kits you could buy at your local grocery.  Also, I was accompanying Jenny Romer on a high school date. 
1384 20030808082208 Small children had run out of my classroom and I stood in the hallway, calling them back.    "That's the voice you have to work on," the teacher next door told me. "You're too stern sounding.  You need to soften it up a bit."  We had already started walking towards the community library.  Two friends were going to meet us there, bearing the rest of our books. When I got in I walked towards the back; the library was lit with the warm glow of books.  My sister couldn't believe I had left our friends on their own to get to the library.    "You need to go outside and wait for them," she said.   So I did.  No sooner had I walked out onto the steps and picked up my wallet then our friends arrived carrying armloads of books.  I hadn't realized how many I was making them carry for us.  Then I was adrift at sea in a tiny boat.  At first I was sitting in the boat.  Someone had knocked a Nashville Yellow Pages into the water, where it floated just at the surface.   Then, somehow, my bag and all its contents fell overboard.  I had to dive in after it in my two piece suit-dress.  There was my bag, getting soaked; the boat and my bag kept pulling farther and farther away from me, no matter how fast I swam.  The sea was endless and the sky above it a stripped-down blue, hazy at the edges like mornings at the ocean before the sea spray is burned away by the sun.

The first was calle Time, the creator; the second was Clock, the preserver; and the third was Alarm, the destroyer.  Then in my dream awake, speeding down the road with Rick at the wheel remembering Long Island, speeding toward 8 a.m. and needing to go to work. 
1401 20060119132608 Allen Brooks from work was telling me about a strange visitor he had received over Christmas.  The woman had come into his home, holding a candle, the traditional offering of good wishes.  Allen could feel the heat from the candle radiate before him.  Then suddenly, as Allen stepped closer, the woman blew the flame of the candle across her hand towards Allen's face.  Allen drew back sharply, surprised.  There was a pint of eggnog in the work refrigerator.  Rick was showing me photos from the Halloweed party we had thrown at my parents' house.  At some point a donkey had wandered into the house and hung out with us for a bit.  I had snapped a photo of it standing in front of the table, where it stood also with a llama and another animal I cannot recall.  In the photo you could e that it was not a true donkey, but a wolf in disguise.    In another photo all of the guests, mostly young toddlers and kids, were assembled at the table, and we were all making faces.  I had snapped this photo somehow from where I sat with them at the table, by turning the camera around and angling it back at us.  Somehow I had gotten my parents' old automatic film camera to make a movie of us sitting there, and now, on the printed photograph, I could see the movie play.  A woman named Chrissy Eckert, "woman of 60,000 instruments", was playing a percussion show this evening in Nashville.  
1403 20030401092208 I'm walking in to high school after walking to school from my old house.  Cherilyn Curtin and Jason Brazier have driven in to school together.  Inside, I say hello to a kid who is an identical twin; I'm not sure to which twin of the set I'm saying hello.  I'm walking up a large stairway, pushing Gloria Kane in a wheelchair.  It's physically exhausting.  Rachel Giordano is by my side until I get to class.   Too many people are in the large lecture hall that will hold Ms. Silberto's early-morning lecture.  At first it's just a regular classroom; Ms. Silberto is doing her typical first-day lecture, which involves using weird statistical formulas to calculate how many people are in class.  Rick is sitting next to me, and he is shouting across the room at  Arie , debating Mideast policy.  I  write out "Rock the Casbah" in large letters on my notebook, but for some reason I don't hold it up.    The classroom turns into a large fancy lecture hall; I start counting the people in the room.  Others in the group are starting to do the same, annoyed by Ms. Silberto's pseudo-statistical exactitude.  Eventually I realize that I am sleeping outside in the dawn rain in my aunt's backyard.  The sheet that I am sleeping on top of has grown into the grass--or rather, the grass has grown through it, but the sheet has faded and the grass has assumed the same paisley hues as the sheet.

1403 20060223090807 warning about the Kroger and Harris Teeter along Highway 70 -- "the two steps in front" which would allow villians to run down people just when they thought they were going to receive help  walking through wood-walled path to the beach.  rick and i get to a tangle of vines.  there is ivy but then there is also poison ivy.  rick goes first and he is holding it up by the non-poisonous part; he keeps holding it up for me  but there at the end the vines fall down around me and i feel a little like i might suffocate.  but rick holds the vines up for me and i get through  beyond, the sand in ridges and then the sea  quadruplets on the beach, on a bench swaddled in white.  the middle-aged mom and the young girl are caring for them.  the one on the very end, closest to the path, has tiny pebbles from the sand close to her mouth. i try to wipe the pebbles from her mouth (they are grey and white and black and pink) but i add more.  the baby, who is the size of my hand, looks up and says "thanks"  then she says other things i have not remembered  then the babies were part of an encyclopedia of christianity, the holy orphan martyrs or relics, but just one page was devoted to them in an encyclopedia of about 300 pages, on glossy paper, paperbacked with durable plastic cover like a tour guide, about 8 x 6"  also in the book the tomb of Diotme, associated with early Christianity  
1417 20060616110408 the muslim private school -- exploring it with companions -- i am concerned we have stumbled up their version of the kaaba when we fling open a set of great wooden doors to lead into a high-vaulted room with green-blue light and all the students sitting at desks oriented around a great box.  but perhaps it is the school lunch room.  in any case i go back through the doors to another side room.  this is the school unch room and rick's cousin alison (inexplicably my companion, due to head to bosnia and another country) is loading herself down with various mexican style pastries, swetbreads and baked goods.  i must help her carry some.  th man in the train station talking with his youn daughter rather flippantly and discouragingly about being an engineer.  i stop to talk with her about what various types of engineers do, and why she too could become one if she decided to pursue it.  the dad starts macking on me and i am disgusted.  the thousands of little mannequins i was making turned into hundreds of manatees, marionettes on string  giving someone a tattoo of the chinese paper cut-out on ben's piece, for good luck and blessing.  this gesture was a final and permanent gesture of goodwill.  as i floated on my back in the sea -- asking "don't you know how to swim?" to the person who did not know how to sleep through the seven minutes of ocean silence provided by the snooze button    
1419 20060622092008 For several hours I tried to look at the beautiful artwork of a man who created smooth black stones, shaped like a Stone Age hammering tool, with rounded edges and an elongated body.  The entire surface of the stone was smooth and solid like basalt and rounded like it had spent thousands of years in a river but if one stepped away from the stone and waited a certain number of minutes (the length of the snooze alarm on the alarm clock) one would see intricate and beautiful scenes in holographic projection from the side of the stone.  I kept waiting to see these and sometimes I would glimpse them but other times just fall asleep.  I kept trying to pass the word on to others about the stones.  A man who looked a little like Doriet's brother Tal, also like some guy from my high school.  His work was all out n the park at various stations.  It was only when I looked at one image of the city marked off with red dots to indicate various places this guy had lived that I realised that we were in Oxford.  Suddenly I grasped the layout of the city and the relationship of various buildings to one another.  Walking now int he night -- heavy traffic, one truck that comes up almost to the curb.  I find the artist on his way into a smoky tavern.  Earlier, I am responsible for feeding all of these penned up dogs (penned up separately in  more or less spacious accommodations) one dog biscuit each.  
1437 20030705073207 another june has gone by   I was supposed to go to the supermarket with two other people to pick up materials for a service project for a children's hospital.  Suddenly I realized that it was twenty 'til five.  I was supposed to have boarded a plane that was departing at 4:45 pm.  I wasn't even in the long line for security, which stretched some thirty or forty people back from the gate, nor did I have my luggage, which was somewhere back in a classroom.  I realized that I would have to take the next flight, which would route me through Newark.  I ran back for my bags; when I came by,t he lines had cleared out and there was a special express lane just for my flight.  Rick was standing in it; he was going to take the same flight too.  There was an elementary school classroom we were helping to clean up.  I had to sweep all along the filthy edges of it.  It was a kindergarten classroom, filled with tiny toys and activities scattered in all sorts of boxes.  Suddenly I was outside, managing the hedge of a man who stood on the other side of the fence and supervised my pruning.  He had a beautiful tree, some sort of witch hazel but with  a strong trunk and boxwood-like foliage.  I was trimming it and he told me not too: it was in shock, still, after two years of growth there.  The wall that I was cleaning and pruning kept switching back and forth between inside and outside, enclosed and open to the air.  
1440 20031109011008 In a small carpeted room with pews, a tiny chapel with a dry bar, Bryce's friend Julia Harvey was getting married.  I had never met her, but I was serving as an emissiary to her wedding.  A man performed some ministerial duty out in one of the side aisles, without anyone beside him; then Julia and her bridegroom got up and stood where he ahd been moments before, and, playing around, made as though to kiss before the minister gave the cue.  Julia talked briefly about her correspondence with Erika Johnson, mentioning something about the unequalness of their exchange--and I thought, guiltily, of my dear friend Katherine Dunn, to whom I owed many letters.  Then Dr. Cierpke from the Trevecca Symphony was there, intending to rehearse us for next week's Thursday concert.  Something was amiss with my viola--it was in the other room, and I had left my folder on my newly rehaired bow, so that large strands of hair had been ripped off in jagged chunks.    When I returned to practice, the room had been transformed into a temple, and I had been selected as one of the priestesses.  My unsavory duties included some sort of ritual mating with gilded bronze statues of various animals.    Later, and strangely, I dreamt for the second time in recent days that something awful had happened to Brandon, and I awoke so quickly and with such a start that in real life I wondered who I should call to find out what had happened. 
1441 20061127211210 the faithful tiger tried to enter the house but it and the other big cat were not allowed in.  outside i sent it and i sat down beside it and began to pet it, in the backyard by the side of the garage.  kate came over to ask me for a natty light from my red bag, but when we opened the malibu there were none left, so she had to take a normal budweiser in an old old can from the sixties instead.  we looked and tried to trace where ceci had driven and the temperature there, the interstates that ran through.  as the swift winter day gathered up and dusk began descending i walked down marble steps of an elaborate living room.  but when i reached the wall there was no wall and i was outside with the steps continuing to a lake or the boundaries of the sea.  the sea pulsed with slower and slower life as the temperature dropped and its waves froze slowly, in motion.  i picked up our things stored at the edge of the water but i let two bundles go accidentally.  one was a manila folder full of stuff, what was it, i dind't knopw. another were some of my supplies, for felting more than anything.  perhaps i would be able to go by the real shore of the freezing water,at the bottom of the stairs, and get back our things from the heart-like sea.  we were cleaning the masoleum house of marble.  it was our workshop and we had let it get most untidy.  i picked up big plastic bags that my sisters had been supposed to tidy.

1456 20030423122607 no exit   A party at my mom's.  I am getting an infinite number of small children and sophisticated party snacks ready.   A large special education teacher, just about my age.  Fragments of the outside side yards of my elementary school.  I meet the special education teacher with the long stringy blond hair and massive arms. She has several students, most notably a child with Tourette's and autism who has been mainstreamed and attends all general education classes.  He is a copious notetaker.  I am astonished at the volume and quality of the notes he takes in the class I attend.  Unfortunately, he does not understand anything of what he writes down--even the brilliant and peripherally-realted diagrams he doodles in his margins.    We are in a dilapidated shack, something out of the tenement shacks of Houston or a small decaying Southern city.  It is afternoon and light is streaming in the roofless room and through the large chinks in the one remaining freestanding wall.  I have left the room; I have been driving around somewhere, but my brakes keep failing and the accelerator pedal is stuck.  I return to the outdoor classroom; the notetaker is gone, but the large woman is still teaching.  I don't want to be in class; I am trying to go through the incogruously placed glass and brick passageway that runs past the classroom and between two locked buildings.  The only entrance to the passageway is through the classroom.  
1456 20060731052207 in the dark night on the groundbeneath the overpass where we stood there was a man sleeping or dead on the corner of a dark wood.  dogs were coming up to him, wild dogs or wolves or coyotes, and sniffing at him, deciding what to do.  there was an old old man in our home and we had to get rid of him.  he was like the lover of dawn who had been granted immortality without eternal youth and he was hopping around our home like a dessicated cricket.  at the same time he was dangerous; he could kill any one of us in our sleep if we did not kill him first.  we prepared our plot to kill him as best we could without being able ever to converse privately to work out a plan.  i had made it known to rick through signs that we needed glue but he brought rubber cement instead ofthe elmer's glue i had hoped for.  i took five or six pairs of scissors from beneath the old an's back while he lay stretched out on a table.  i felt bad because i lied about whether he would need them to defend himself.  the old man had disappeared but we were trying to rid ourselves of his wife or companion, a beautiful and sweet red-headed jewish woman.  i motioned to rick that we did not have to kill her and figured out a way to let her stay.  my cousin rachel had a "secret garden", but it was not secret but rather directlyon the corner of their property where most people who passed could see her rock gardenand plants in containers, tastefully arranged. 
1465 20030307011807 [I didn't get to post these before, because I went back to bed after I wrote down my earlier dreams...I finally got my ass out of bed about half-an-hour after the time I should have left the house in order to get to be on time anywhere that I needed to be this morning, so I didn't write the rest of my dreams down this morning.]  My old roommate Danielle was in a public restoom, perhaps in a college dorm.  The restroom was unlit, and we were all worried; if the restroom was unlit it could be unsafe.  Murderers and rapists could hang out in it, and indeed, as I walked into the pitch-dark restroom to see if Danielle was there, I felt uneasy, and I thought I saw a shadowy spectral form in the long full-length mirror in the wall.  Danielle was in there, and we talked about forming a non-profit organization that would oversee the safety of women's restrooms.    A racoon was walking across a wooden porch, except it shifted shapes as it walked and became a bizarre, creature, a cross between a badger and a wildcat.  Dreams of organization and getting a pile of materials ready.  I am digging or pawing through layers and layers of time, stacked on me like old alarm clocks I've seen, with the numbered leaves that flap over each other in procession as the minutes and hours pass.  I am digging through sand that falls on me as though from an hourglass.  Time is a tangible entity I am working my way through; it is difficult to walk through.  
1469 20030411091408 I was walking across what looked like parched marshland.  The ground was almost dry enough to fissure; you could see tiny cracks forming.  There was a cliff behind me, but the land around me was as barren as the spot I walked across--there was no sign of an ocean or river anywhere nearby.  Suddenly I saw that the sinkhole by my feet was rapidly filling with water, and that the culvert that emptied into it had turned into a torrential stream.  The sun was out, shining brightly, and I realized that the frozen streams, the snow and ice atop far-off mountains were all melting.  The creek had turned into a wash of white water--I looked above me, to the cliff--a waterfall's worth of water was about to crush me on its way to join the stream.  I leapt up the face of the cliff, scrambling up strange ice formations in the shape of rock.    Much later, I stood with my sisters Kate and Sarah on the other side of the cliff, gazing at a slew of people that had gathered on the top and sides of the cliff.  We scrambled up it; the sky above us looked like a worn blue wool blanket with the sun shining dimly behind it.  We reached the top and looked down; the water was still pouring down, and it looked like the swelling waves of the ocean.  The water itself was only about twenty or thirty feet beneath the eighty foot cliffs; when the waves would swell, they almost knocked us over.  I kept telling my sisters to move back from the edge of the cliff.  
1473 20030310082208 ...only fragments today, as I am in a rush and cannot think to remember my dreams.  The face of a haughty middle-aged woman in purple floating over a concert hall stage where a young woman is playing.  "The purple pianist; my one accomplishment," the haughty woman says in voiceover as she walks through a row of seated people looking for her own seat.  She has on an Edwadian dress with a strange bustle.  My sister Kate was baking muffins in the oven, but they were taking too ong to cook.  They were large muffins, about six to eight inches across--bran, orange, apple, corn.  She kept opening the oven to check on them but they didn't get much more cooked.  I was a special ed teacher who had gone away on a long inservice, or perhaps I had stopped teaching.  In any case I was checking in back at school.  Somehow I knew that people had not been looking after my student Jeli.  Indeed, she had been locked in the school overnight with the lights out.  It was already nine or ten o'clock.  I gathered her up in my arms and brought her back to her home.  Her parents were there, worrried, but I had the feeling they had been smoking up in back to assuage their nervousness.  I was trying to determine whether I had or had not let them know that I would be going out of town and that they would need to be extra vigilant about Jeli.  I was telling them that they had a right to demand that Jeli be placed in general education classes as much as possible.  
1473 20060811100809 Lisa K. gave me three or four handmade sweaters from wool fleece and felt.  She was moving and thought I would get more use out of them. THey were beautiful with colors and somewhat large.  She had gotten someone at the "clothing mall" to make them.  THe seams were held together with bands of fused silk.  A bug with, at first, just a black body and an annoying and disturbing habit of sticking to me was following me everywhere despite repeated attempts to flick it off.  I screamed each time it attached itself to e (mostly to my leg).  It became a creature with a horrible long spindly tail that was like a feeler.  Later it turned into a friendly reddish haired dog that just wanted to play (it tried to pull some sort of washers game, because it liked the red rope on the end).  I looked down at the ground to see an earthworm brought up because of the wet soil.  I realized the bug, the dog, the worm were all the same, and following me because they loved me; that is, because they were the same as me and wanted to be with me.  I went up the hill with Sarah to see the plants I thought might be ground cherry.  Rick lived in an apartment complex.  I was playing a bright orange high-gloss (lacquered?) saxaphone.  I could not find the music on my stand that the lady wanted us to play.  I felt like crying.  I went out into the rain in my socks.  There were puddles of water everywhere.  It was night; Rick followed me. We walked to his apartment.   
1474 20060409091807 Our project was to make a Rube Goldberg-like machine that would keep an egg in nearly perpetual motion for as long as possible; or rather, to move the egg in as many different directions for equivalent distances as possible.  Our contraption shot the egg up very high along a slide-like portion of our machine; then it came down with enough velocity to shoot across the room, hit a liitle ramp at the top of an angled-up jump, and come back down.  I looked at the set-up carefully, and pronounced solenly, well, if we have four parts of the apparatus completed, we must strive for five."  Our advisor, a charming, frizzy-haired lady from Japan, was talking about waht we might do to get more velocity as the egg came off the smaller ramp. I thought I might put folded up cloths over the ramp to make the surface bigger but the woman suggested these metal plates that we were not able to attach with anything, just place.  Janie from  Their Eyes Were Watching God  crawled into Tea Cake's car and scribbled purple crayon over his yellow crayon circles all over the dashboard, to let him know she still loved him.  I was sitting at the table with Kate's childhood self and others, trying not to laugh as both Kate and I ate the flesh off giant rinds of pink grapefruit that were turned nearly inside out.  At the end most strongly my head was singing to myself a song that mixed together B & S's "Seymour Stein" and Jacques Brel's "No, Love, You're Not Alone". 
1487 20060812111813 In the classroom we had passed in our essays and were waiting around for something.  Laura Sobik was there.  We talked about why there was a resurgence of Muslims wearing fezs.  I brought up some long-winded explanation about maximizing your feelings of group belonging by maximizing the differences bewteen you and other non-group members.  We got our bento box style lunch of fresh produce for the month, only it wasn't fresh -- a few rubbery okra, some apples from far off land, sorted by cardboard dividers, a measly potato, some things that may have been avocado pears, but round and with spikes.  I decided to make a fruit salad.  The fruit salad was all eaten.  I was looking over the paper with the tacher: apparently I had gotten a good grade, because I had done a good job restating the argument, but I needed to improve including my own interpretation, application, and challenge to the author's findings.  Someone had grabbed the pestle from my mortar and pestle set and was using it as a microphone.  Naked Dave came over and started laughing about how I had once taken a hard boild egg and cracked it open on my blazer.  Laura Sobik was getting anxious about going to track practice.  I had seen Paul Garritano at some point.  A large woman was hanging out in front of the two fridges int he class, in front of the chalkboard.  She was trying to write in chalk on their textured surface.  I had signed up for winter track but I didn't want to be part of it. 
1496 20030331092807 A house that is my parents' but is not, full of windows letting in golden summer twilight.  The air is sparkling as it sometimes does at this hour, as though the air around us is heavier and refracts the golden light back onto our faces, sothat the earth offers us as much illumination as the sun.  I am putting away blocks of thin 3 inch by 5 inch wood into a giant, six foot by six foot single drawer of a  type case cabinet .    Some of the blocks have portions of a letter I have started to my friend Ryan in Seattle.  Many of the sentences, though, are unfinished.  I am culling some of the fragmentary sentences--I can no longer remember what it was that I was trying to say in these passages.  A yong version of Kate is watching me.    "I remember when you used to write funny letters," she says.  "You used to write them to us--eight, nine pages long, with tiny handwriting."  My Nanny is watching as we are putting things away.  She's been complaining that she is falling more, lately--her knee gives out, it seems.  She says something to my mom, who nods distractedly and says that she has to go to the bathroom.    "Bathroom, bathroom," my Nanny says.  "Always with the bathroom.  Just like me and my knee."       Later on, dimly--I am in a room with Laura Sobik and Jen Romer.  The end of the world is approaching.  We are doing some stuff to get ready but I am not being much help; I do not feel that much can be done the day of to prepare for the end of the world.   
1496 20030513050008 dream of 5/11, or, mom, i swear to god my superego wished you a happy mother's day, even if my id did not ;-)   Rick and I were in a large kitchen with some family, gathering for a big holiday meal.  We were all bringing food downstairs.  We'd sent a bunch of desserts and main dishes down, and now we had a little tray of lemon bars with chocolate on the bottom.  My mom was going to carry the tray down, but I wanted us to be able to carry something, too--she already had a tray of food.    Then my mom made a comment about the bars--how they probably weren't that good.  I gave her one of the bars to taste and as she tasted it she made a face.  She stood at the sink, washing dishes, and I wheeled around and yelled at her.  My Nanny began to speak from the other side of the kitchen counter, where she sat in a wooden chair with her sister Madeleine beside her.  I walked around the ocunter and resumed yelling, this time at both my mom and grandma.  "She's more like her," my Nanny said to my mom, gesturing first to me and then to her sister Madeleine.  "I can be like you if I want," I was shouting at my Nanny, "all rational and imperial, but I'm tired of it"  "She's passionate, Ro," said my aunt Maddy in my defense.  "And part of being truly passionate is having a little temper."  The vehemence and extremity of my angry responses puzzled me.  I did not think that my anger was righteous, only bizarre and misplaced.  Later on we were hanging with some deaf people.

1551 20060119175007 Allen Brooks from work was telling me about a strange visitor he had received over Christmas.  The woman had come into his home, holding a candle, the traditional offering of good wishes.  Allen could feel the heat from the candle radiate before him.  Then suddenly, as Allen stepped closer, the woman blew the flame of the candle across her hand towards Allen's face.  Allen drew back sharply, surprised.  There was a pint of eggnog in the work refrigerator.  Rick was showing me photos from the Halloweed party we had thrown at my parents' house.  At some point a donkey had wandered into the house and hung out with us for a bit.  I had snapped a photo of it standing in front of the table, where it stood also with a llama and another animal I cannot recall.  In the photo you could e that it was not a true donkey, but a wolf in disguise.    In another photo all of the guests, mostly young toddlers and kids, were assembled at the table, and we were all making faces.  I had snapped this photo somehow from where I sat with them at the table, by turning the camera around and angling it back at us.  Somehow I had gotten my parents' old automatic film camera to make a movie of us sitting there, and now, on the printed photograph, I could see the movie play.  A woman named Chrissy Eckert, "woman of 60,000 instruments", was playing a percussion show this evening in Nashville.  Why did my face look so strange, there, glimpsed in the mirror?  It was because I had grown a day's worth of greyish-blue stubble, like a hobo clown. 
1556 20060308082408 Murfreesboro paper sack and paper good outlet -- to be moved to 1312 Acklen, next to Bryce's new house.  Woman telling me about the importance of the morning goodwill meditation.  This way, she said, if you got another session in at least six days a week you'd meditate eight times, an important number.  Yet the math did not make sense.  I would not be able to pick up some people from the airport as I was going there myself, but at some indeterminate time.  I erased a long email message almost at its end.  We were looking at various baby zoo animals.  They wound up in pens beneath my parents' overturned kitchen table.  One of them turned into a baby turtle.  I was supposed to watch it so that it didn't wind up crawling underneath something and getting stuck, but I let it crawl behind my parents' kitchen sink and counter nonetheless.  It was moving too fast.  Later I found it with Dr. C, my orchestra conductor.  The back of the counter and sink was much more accessible than I had anticipated.  The turtle was hanging out close to the front, tired of all the attention being foisted upon it.  Later I was drawing a picture of city buildings coming up from city streets in a birds'-eye view.  The buildings were made up entirely of the words "your so lonely", which were lyrics to a song that was playing endlessly in the background: "walking down city streets, but you're so lonely, but you're so lonely".  Then I realized that "your" should be spelled "you're".  I was trying to add in the letters without affecting the design. 
1558 20060515104408 Trying to walk across the street with its hundreds of tram or trolley lines, each with a different strangely costumed person following its path as though compelled onward by wire.  I was going against the direction of everyone, but one person beside me was doing the same.    There was a middle eastern food place that had food out for our commuter breakfast.  Massood Taj was trying to photograph me as I walked down a long dark hallway but I pretended not to see him.  There was an article on the counterculture of the counterculture of events like Burning Man.  "But in addition to hemp-wearing technology geeks," the article read, "there's a pervasive culture of homo-erotic literary trust-fund vagabonds."  The article went on to describe them, including one -- "healthy and thickset when he arrived, he nonetheless perished of starvation after refusing to eat once the troop was forced to start barbecueing its emergency rations of vegetarian (non-vegan) fake seafood."  Hilda Fehd was leaving the state.    Bryce McCloud had a book of poems, one for each of the months.  "Joe Bob", Rusty Wolfe's son, had just been found dead.  The police were trying to ascertain the cause of death and they thought that a gun set up as a clock was responsible.  "Started off as just another stoner fight," one officer said.  But soon we saw how the gun had backfired when chemical salts had built up on the inside of the "charging plate". "I'm not surprised that this happened," said the marshal, "based on the rate of salt deposition on this plate." 
1572 20060228090008 - i tried developing the photos i ahd taken but ghosts and our young   selves (kate's and other cousins' and my own) kept appearing in them.   also, whatever i had shot was different than the spots i had actually   walked with my subject, who may have been joe hardwick but was also   someone else.  there was a whole set of shots supposed to   take place in a field but instead the shots ranged from a vineyard   to the harbor by my parents' house: joe's back with wings made out of the   vines illuminated by sun; the tips of our faces in water made green by   seaweed and blue by sky; walking across water?  - when i stopped by the photo developing place, it was my aunt chris   behind the counter.  i tried explaining that i had, for instance,   dropped off a package of black and white film to be developed, and had   color film returned, but relaized that what i was explaining didn't   make much sense.  - someone decided the best place to smoke their marijuana cigarette was   in the back of a police car, during the time while the six officers who   had been stuck in the car, clown-style, were out walking the beat.   the officers were very friendly to me, smiling and waving.  the people   int he back of the car eventually realized where they were, and,   somewhat panicked, stumbled over each other in order to get out.  - i was taking a bath in the middle of the room, but the clothes that   were hanging around the bathtub to dry were falling out.  shards of   pastel colored metal were falling into the tub and were swirling   inside it.    
1574 20060125080207 Two jokes I made up in my dream and told my sisters, who were not amused:  Q. What's the best day to see someone in March? A. The "Eye"des of March.  Q. Why is March a bad time for rabbit visits? A. Because the March Hare is hopping mad.  Leaving my parents' house under cover of night, I ran to Steve and Edna's house next door, little more than a masoleum above grass.  None of the streetlights we on, yet the yard was creepily front lit by a single light source at some distance down the road.  I was scared and each time a car came down the road (several did in the time I was out there) I attempted to hide by concealing myself behind bushes.  But I knew at least one of the drivers had seen me and was circling around, so I ran back up the driveway in the pitch black, collapsed into the house, locking the door behind me.  Later, Sarah, Kate and I were all preparing for a standardized exam like the SATs.  Sarah was the only one diligently preparing.  We would have to go into New York City to take the test.  Kate and I were flopping around on the bed where Sarah was studying. "You guys are not taking this seriously," Sarah said.    "Don't you know that I work best when I'm relaxed?" I told Sarah.  She was writing an essay on the strange, inedible Mongolian fruit the  kyrz  (kirkusk?) that grew so beautifully, with full moon shaped leaves and white flowers, even on the steps of the Vatican.    We needed to have a healthy breakfast but I was at a loss for what to serve myself.  It was alost time to go and Kate and I still needed to shower.  
1577 20060411104807 Walking through endless subterrenean passages of a house I have been through in different parts of many dreams.  Perhaps we descended in rickety elevators or climbed spiral staircases; now I can't remember. Later, after we had walked through the stalls of artisans selling hand-crafted wares and the large rooms of musicians playing tunes and selling their merchandise and lessons, I went out to meet my mom and sister only to find that my mom had thoughtfully loaded my viola and another fiddle inside the trunk.  Only it was not my fiddle (at least, I didn't think I had brought it), and my viola was in an old ratty case, not my own.  I was angry at my mom instead of grateful.  She was apologetic and explained that I had just left without taking care of my instrument, and she hadn't been sure whether I was coming back for it or not, so she took it with her -- but didn't know how to pack it up, as I hadn't left any instructions.  This made me feel worse.  I went back to look for it.  The fair was closing up and I wandered around the U-shaped hall of galleries where I had spent the most time.  I glanced half-heartedly over piles of merchandise and taken-down display materials but did not start searching thoroughly.  A couple was searching through the monuments at the state capitol building in Nashville, looking for a place to hook up.  But they settled instead under a small oak sapling in Braintree, Massachussetts.  Their publi hook-up was a form of protest against a government that instruded into people's private spaces and against a culture 
1582 20040627142407 In a bus travelling across the back hills of a rural land -- at once the island where I had grown up and another, older place, that had been made not by glaciers but by chthonic powers -- in this bus we drove by the burial mounds of ancient civilizations, the walls and boundaries set up to keep lives from touching one another.  Coming around the curve, I saw the green expanse of the haunted hill unroll before my eyes, the green lands where cattle, closed in by barbed wire, grazed.  I recognized it now.  People protesting war -- not just any specific war, but war in general -- had seceded from our country and set up camp here.  On the barbed wire fence on the far side of the encampment, the side we were rolling towards, the hand-lettered sign read: "Within the larger war, a war on war."  I looked beyond the sign to where row on row of luminaria candles stood in white paper bags, arrayed like headstones in a military cemetary.  I looked beyond, to where the dead ranks of candle-filled bags had turned into hanging ghosts filled with dead leaves, scattering ashes.  The place would always be haunted, I realized.  Back on the bus, I was singing "War on War", though I had never known the lyrics.  I sang it softly at first, but soon the whole bus was singing, too.  Elsewhere, the bright light of a sunny winter afternoon, when sun shone white and clear like icicles through the empty tree branches, into the ruined rhodendron forest just up the hill from my parents' house, where the earth curved down on all sides as though to the bottom of a fishbowl. 
1601 20030322114807 passenger side   We were driving in a car.  We were just about to drive over a railroad track when one of the passengers said, "Turn here."  "Here" was a crude road running right alongside the track.  Our driver, an anthropology and African Studies professor, seemed skeptical, but the passenger who had made the request told him everything would be fine.   But they were doing maintenance and construction on the road.  Huge machines--some like combine-reapers with cranes attached to them, some like amphibious craft with giant plows on their fronts, some the length of three tractor trailers with the accordion-like joiners city buses sometimes wear--were backing up, turning around, and maneuvering about recklessly.   Some people in the back were worried, but the driver just said, as we passed under a low-hung metal pole, strategically placed on an incline, "Nah, I'm not worried."  But then we drove up the small incline, almost clipping the roof of the compact car on the pole, and saw an enormous pile of compressed boxes, stretching far as the eye could see, completely blocking the road.  They stood at least twenty stories tall, neatly stacked.    Two huge Mack trucks with dump trucks on the back of them busted through the boxes, clearing a space through them to dirive with their momentum, and catching the boxes they displace with the dump trucks on their backs.  "Yes," we thought--we could drive through now.  But as the trucks drove through, clearing a space, boxes fell off very high shelves, forty stories above, and landed neatly stacked, blocking our way again. 
1604 20060215080607 There was a black dog penned up in a fenced-in area inside a room where I was gathering up my belongings so that I could go.  Friends from all over were coming over my parents' house for a party and I wanted to get back there with my stuff so that I could hang out for one little bit before beginning a long journey overseas.  The dog was scary though, small, muscular and compact, with pepper flecks of white and red showing through its skin near its belly, like a wild dog.  It had a strange large collar around its neck, shaped like a trough, about a foot and a half across, with a separate funnel in the center from which its neck emerges.  This in part immobilized its neck so it couldn't attack people or get out of the gate, which I now see is unlocked and cracked open, but the dog has figured out how to get out even with the collar on, and also how to position its mouth so that it can still attack people.  I am trying to climb the fence to sit on top of it so that the dog can't get me, and at the same time hop down now and then to gather up the rest of my stuff.  At some point I realize the dog is no longer a threat.  My mom moving dishes and other serving ware upstairs to be closer to the new dining room in my parents' house, a room fashioned out of the upstairs hallway.  Stuffing a chicken for some other elaborate recipe of which stuffed chicken was just a part (not turducken though).  No ready-made stuffing so I must make it fresh.  This goes on for a long time with many variations until finally I wake up because I am so frustrated with this part of the dream.  
1613 20060131113407 Map with aerial view of the early European immigrants to each state.  Those in first to Tennessee were beautiful Irish folk with pale skin and flaming red curly hair.  Panning to Kentucky one saw, gathered for a feast day, their dark haired dark-eyed counterparts, also from Ireland but from the wilds farther north, along the coast.  And they were wilder and more savage and perhaps more lovely.   But there was another gathering, this one for a Norwegian festal day, and all of the children were blond haired and blue-eyed with fair, almost golden skin.  And they rode in to the crowd on horses with plumes on their head as in the circus.  The children, some as small as six months, would ride several kids to a horse, strapped in with fabric belts kind of like the fastening straps for the car-top carrier.   Riding in was one older woman with a Dutch boy page, natural shining blond.  She had enormous clear light blue eyes that, when you looked at them from the side, had a tiny straight tube coming out from them, each right in the center of her pupil.  She was telling of her work for the hynoptist research-artist, how he would stretch his eyes open wide and try to tell his young patients with his mind to select certain graven images from a grid of four.    "Why couldn't he just use eye movements to do this?" I asked and she launched into a long explanation.  But I knew that I myself had communicated to my students the correct answers from a grid of pictures simply by moving my eyes, so I didn't think his research could be very accurate if he didn't take this into consideration.   
1625 20030505092008 Driving in a taxi, I had to share the middle seat and seat belt with some boy I'd known a long time ago.  Four people were int he back seat.  In the arcade shopping center.  The store selling three items of clothing for ninety-nie cents--"the 2 1/2 husband sale", they called it.  A woman across the way selling handmade soaps.  Her home base was just outside Louisville, KY, and she made the soaps outside in her backyard. She had two bars with natural sponges built into the soaps themselves. However, one set of soaps actually had plastic sponges in the shape of natural sponges inside of them.    My Nanny was with our group, along with some friends of hers.  She was asking me whether I wanted some soaps--I didn't, at least not from this booth--and then criticizing me for collecting beanie babies a long time ago with a boy she had really detested.  I was standing, looking over the soaps and the flowery journals, trying to place who she meant.  Much later, I was crossing a ravine that was also a room, enclosed on four sides.  I had just finished administering a reading test to my old student Anjelica--it was five or ten years after I had taught her, and I needed to measure her progress.  She was reading exceptionally well, but we only got halfway through the test because her attention wandered.  She still looked about six years old.  In the ravine that was a room, my neighor from down the street, her young daughter, and her teenage daughter were wrapping bacon around chickedn wings.  It was both dinner and a craft project, but the older daughter was complaining that she had to make them. 
1628 20060410092407 -riding the late bus home from mount sinai middle school.  was it even  the right bus?  amanda bellafiore was on it, which didn't seem correct. i had so many plastic bags tha as i walked down the aisles carl papparella teased me.  but for once i was not cowed and just said, "i'm like a bag lady"  just before the last seat of the busi found a spot next to adam welch and sat down.  -the french boarding house, csa, cosmetic sales headquarters, and site of many strange entrepreneurial endeavors.  i wanted to leave as not one of the sevenor so owners listed in the front door registry were at home. but my mom had us wait around, and when the owner finally came i was chagrined.    -but soon inside i did not mind.  the houses furnishings were very french, including a strange portable bidet.  i met all the family.  -i was gathering gifts for all of the many pets the house maintained -- simultaneously i was fulfilling or workign off a curse that had been placed upon us.  i had made a list of the things i would get each strange animal -- the three over-large dogs, the black cat with the six or seven nails on each paw, the white scared cat with the face, ears, and back-side of a rabbit.  but looking over the animals, callign them over and petting them, i re-thought each of my gifts.  originally, too, i thought i would send each one in its own package, addressed to the animal care of the manor house, but rethought that as wasteful, as well. on the ground i read some letter from a lady that wanted to give a parentless child a daily after-school treat of pudding with her intial, "j", swirled in it.   
1634 20030114091608 Three Great Tastes...  Just before I woke up, I was trying to tell my dad some joke involving the terms "dormitory", "dumbitory", and "vomitory".  But it really wasn't funny at all.   The Boxcar Children  Earlier in my dreams I had gone to investigate a large swath of wooded  land, flocked by hills, that had already begun to be developed.  I  wanted to see the extent of the clearing and construction so I set off  behind the row of   tract mansions   at  the edge of the field.  The field dropped off before rising into a  wooded ridge, scarred by the paths of construction vehicles and logging  equipment.  A culvert ran between the field and the rise, and from the distance I had seen shimmering pockets of mirages lying in the culvert.   As I got closed I realized they were deep pools of salt.  Suddenly I was encumbered by a car--my car, the Malibu.  I was not  riding in it, but rather dragging it behind me until such time as I  would need it.  I worried about taking it across the shifting quicksand  salt pools.  So I strapped it across my back and found the shallowest  path across the pools.  Then I set off along the crude road--pockmarked,  riddled with gaps and boulders--just beneath the ridge.    I was walking away from the field, away from the stripped ridge. I  reached another wooded area with tiny cottages scattered throughout it  like a gypsy settlement.  I saw some kids outside and wanted to show  them my car, which by this time I was pulling behind me on a rope.  But  when I turned to show it off, it had turned into a cardboard box with  one wheel in front, two in back, like a go-cart. 
1634 20030227070607 Insert Text Here   We were downtown in a small city inside what seemed to be a specialty deli or gourmet food shop, with partly bowed wooden floors and an old glass-panelled countertop display.  We had a disk that held all the files we wanted printed.    When we brought it to the deli counter, the employees fed it into a machine which began spitting out prints of the individual files just like the deli meat slicer slices meat.  Individual slices of our files began falling from this printer, and someone stood beneath it,  wrapped it up in coated butcher paper, and priced it by the pound for us.  One file remained on the disk, but the employees had already removed the disk from the machine, so they didn't realize it hadn't printed.  The machine was still going, but without the disk to read it just started spitting out its default material, which was rice.  We shouted for the employees to stop the machine, which they did.  They bagged up the rice for us anyway.  There was some tool on the edge of the counter that was the primitive version of the machine we had used.  It was made of black cast iron, and looked exactly like an old fashioned meat grinder; yet it produced prints.   Through all my dreams this same theme ran; I needed something printed and I had to run around and get it done in some bizarre way.  As I kept dreaming, all the color leached out of my dreams.  By the time I dreamt of a  man who was showing off the cards he collected from people like us (which he didn't even bother to read--just lined up along his shelves), everything was in black and white and the occasional half-tone.   
1636 20030612080008 We were at a family function spread throughout multiple outdoor buildings.  I was trying to escape the one section I was in; I hd something else I wanted to do.  My mom was trying to get me to eat french fries and some sort of omelette.  I didn't want any.    I stepped past aunts and uncles and cousins, walking through the kitchen where everyone was clustered and onto a small stoop.  The day stetched out grey before me.  For some reason the outline of everything stood out very clearly.  My mom had foloowed me outside with a big tray of omelette, french fries and scrambled eggs.  "I don't want it, Ma," I said, but she kept trying to foist in on me anyway.  She grew angry and then sad when I refused to take it. "I hat all this stuff, Ma," I said, but I agreed to at least eat the scrambled eggs.  But I was mad.  I grabbed the plate from her and started running.  There was a hill not far from the party.  It was littered with old, abandoned technology; at the top of the hill was a spot where you could sit, surrounded by old presses, archaic reapers, and crumbling library-bound theses, and achieve enlightenment.  That's wehre I was heading.  In my clogs the run up the hill felt like running up glass.  I thought about kicking them off, but I had no free hand to carry them, since I had to hold the tray.  I almost had reached the top of the hill when I sensed someone behind me.  Turning back, I saw my mom at the base of the hill.  I was ducking down behind old paper cutters and grain sorters to hide from her.  She was bouncing up and down on her toes, trying to find the top of my head.  She spotted me. 
1636 20060526114208 stone steps down to a walled off but open-air patio area.  the area was a strange mix of urban and rural.   the little child next to me would accompany down there (though i thought her mother might get nervous having her go with a stranger).  i wanted to make sure that the squirrels i had seen down there got fed.  one was the dream incarnation of the chipmunk i had seen the day before in real life, dragging its back legs, wounded or paralyzed, through the grass slowly.  i brought down peanuts, just a few shelled halves, and threw them to each of the three squirrels, which were hiding underneath a metal porch glider.  i tried to aim so that the two squirrels on the edge would have to turn their attention away from the glider to get their food, so that the wounded squirrel in the middle could get to the food i threw directly to it even though it moved much more slowly. turning back around, since the squirrels had dispersed, i found that more peanuts had emerged in my hand, so i prepared to distribute them again.  but when i looked up a baby black bear was crossing my path.  he walked around like an acrobat on a tightwire, swaying slightly side to side.  both the little girl and i watched him but we stayed away because we didn't want to disturb him, or get his (nowhere in-sight) mother worried.  i fed the squirrels again.  my mom was appearing.  baby kangaroo in fighting pose.  i pet it and it bounds away.  i pick up what i thought was garbage off the ground.  it is a half-smushed but still alive box turtle.  it looks at me and extends back to its normal size.  cobey delk and his hidden artwork?  
1657 20030925004408 Camels camels camels: some with two humps, but most with one.  We owned a camel resale shop, and I was in the process of wrangling with a Beduoin over a lot of camels he had transported by boat to the States.  Inching my way on my back across the rickety and wind-blown suspension bridge.  Somehow I was like Alice in Wonderland when she ate the wrong cake and grew too large for her little room, or like Gulliver pinioned by Lilliputians.  My body stretched the length of the bridge and yet I could not get off of it; I was pinned beneath the pylons and the arches.  I kept a packet of paper close to my body, shielding it from the grey rain.  Roger Joynes, our landlord, came over to check on the leaky kitchen ceiling.  We were sad we didn't tell him earlier about the buckling we had seen there.  Stopping by the Guzzetta's house, where I was staying for a while, I left Bryce a message about a poster we were supposed to be designing.  Dogs were fenced in all up and down the residential street.  I ran nearer to some, taunting or playing with them, I couldn't tell which.  Suddenly I glimpsed the filming of a public service announcement about wolves.  Then I was in the shoot, being pursued by wolves myself.  Only the wolf pack turned into a single wolf, the incarnation of evil itself.  It had trapped me, it thought, at the top of a bookcase, and I was scratching at its face and eyes with wire coat hangers.  Suddenly it was revealed to me that I had been elected one of the immortal ones, Kan Win.  I was putting tortillas in the oven in someone's kitchen, with Rick, explaining that he had just been fighting soemthing immortal. 
1673 20031204104408 Thu. 4 Dec. cash in now  In the classroom we begin our lesson: we are having a test on various mythological transformations.  Our job in each is to determine who is being transformed, and into what.  We view a slide show: a man in love with a nymph transforms her into a mountain and a frozen river.  He is skiing down her frozen passes; the mountain itself is made of brocade, velvet, lace, and a deep green ice and powdery snow.  There is a whole set of questions associated with these images, a set of problems aimed at developing matehmatical formulas for various aspects of the man's or the mountain's motion.  The whole point of the exercise, I realize, is to determine the name of the man, and the type of transformation he is undergoing.  Suddenly, his name comes to me: Hillary, Sir Edmund Hillary.  But I cannot just write his name down, though I know that it is right.  I have to mathematically prove that this is the man I already know it to be.  In my dream I confuse the word "aegis" with "etiology"--and the word "aegis" means, at some level, "struck into place by the hand of God; origin or beginning".  This is the type of transformation I think this man and this mountain have gone through.  I have realized that, though the film presented Hillary as changing the nymph he loved into a mountain, those rocks were actually a mountain all along, never a woman.  Hillary grew to love this mountain as though it were a woman.  He has changed, somehow; he himself is turning into stone.  There is another set of problems I must solve, after I give the equation for Hillary's transformation, a set of logic problems about prostitutes in Sweden.  
1684 20030129173208 Rock the Casbah   The city (NashVegas) had become Islamicized.  There were open-air  markets stretching up and down West End, 21st, and all the streets and  campus space in between.  I was veiled, and I was standing at a payphone reading a list of things that were  haram .  (For a woman this  included eating more than a teaspoon of brown sugar at a time--but  taking a lover was acceptable.)  I walked through the town from my house to a coffeeshop on 21st Avenue.   I spotted two friends inside and said hello, but I kept on walking,  through Vanderbilt's main campus up to West End.  There was a man inside  another coffeeshop: I'd seen him before, and I knew he had just immigrated here from China. He was playing violin, and I realized that I  had promised him that we would play together informally one of these  days.  I walked away before he could see me.  A car almost hit me as I  walked across the street without looking.    I'd walked enough for that day; it felt as though I had walked all day,  though the sun told me that it was still just mid-morning.  Outside an  upscale shoe store, the employees and some adolescent volunteers from a  local youth center were getting ready for a clearance sale. I was  trying to help another recent Chinese immigrant, a woman, understand the instructions for her uniform.  She had to wear her hair in two low  pigtails; she had to wear a solid-colored collared polo shirt; she had  to sew a "collar" of the same color and material onto her high-top  sneakers.  Inside the store, there were all these postcards of obscure artists and  their artwork on them--I was trying to decide which of these, if any, to  buy.    
1695 20060530070408 The Blamey's house was set up with many sewing machines as though for a cottage industry.  The house had been cleaned up but there were still piles of the Blamey's old things in other rooms of the house.  Sarah and I were going to work there with Tiffany and Sam.  The house was glowing with light and I thought to myself that we would need to get curtains so that no one would know that we were working there.  Corie and Erin pulled up in a white van to my parents' house.  I almost just missed them because I was going to try to catch Paul Garritano at his band practice.  Earlier I tlaked with Jay Freeman and he made me laugh and laugh.  We were looking for a chair that I wanted to sell.  It wound up being inside a lingerie shop, so Mike Wells and Daniel Boudon (?) and I had to put away the underwear and bras that the employees had already stacked on top of it.  Just a few minutes earlier some LA music produceer type whom we had recently met came in to let me know that he had purchased some work of art that I was selling.  It was a nest, but I didn't think that it had been mine.  Photos inside my sketchbook had solarized themselves to the page.  They made the photographic images stand out in stark black and white, with intereting texture and pattern.  Mike Wells was experimenting with them. Someone was talking about Alex Budnitz.  A wedding invitation from Karen Hoff, Nashville real estate agent.  I didn't understand if the invitation was a bulk mail solicitation but finally I figured out that we were actually invited.  The wedding would be a dramatic reenactment of the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe.  Our names kept changing on the multiple envelopes inside. 
1711 20040123234207 I dreamt I was inside a supermarket that contained all of the world within its boundaries; or rather I dreamed I was outside but everything around me was enclosed within four walls.  In the center of the supermarket was a grassy square encircled by a race track.  As I sat and watched, other people gathered around the edges of the square.  The conquerer of the world was coming.  His horse drawn carriage arrived.  In the back sat a man and a woman in the clothing of the early 19th century royal court.  They were a couple.  Sprawled out behind them, seriously inebriated, lay the conquerer of the world, his grey shirt open almost to the waist and his black boots pointed at the sky.  They were circling Red Square in Moscow.  Napoleon (for that was the drunk man) had conquered Russia.  His brow was dripping with sweat.  I dreamt I glimpsed Doriet, doing good deeds among the flower gardens of the Music Row roundabout.  I dreamt of my Aunt Ginny's house being packed up for her move, and a drunken homeless man who stumbled in the house, his hands in his flannel shirt gesticulating wildly.  I tried to get him to go outside without going in any of the other rooms, without disturbing the rest of the family gathering that was going on in some other side room.  He wasn't supposed to be there.  I held him close to me as I led him outside.  He smelled of cigarettes, unwashed clothes, sour beer, the smell so intense that it made my face wrinkle.  We walked along the street.  Suddenly I realized that I trusted him; that I wanted him to be happy; that I wanted him to succeed.  I smelled again the acrid smell of cigarettes and dirty clothes mixed together.  I loved him.  He was gone.    
1719 20030515080008 oh to live on sugar mountain   We were about to get in a car heading to somewhere in Tennessee; we'd reached the last stop in Civilizatin, before national forest and wilderness took over.  Rick was going to go to the restroom so I figured I'd have time to go, too.  There was an amazing variety of vending machines inside the rest area.  There were coffee machines and coke machines, of course, but then there was also an entire case devoted to self-serve Rusell Stover chocolate logs, jelly rolls, pecan clusters and other somewhat disgusting looking chocolates, all arranged like those machines where you pay fifty cents to  manipulate a mechanical arm to pick up a prize and deposit it.  There was a case with baked potatoes.  And there was a bizarre  Slurpee-style  dispensing machine hanging from the ceiling of the actual stall of the restroom.  It put out Code Red icees and other such things, and the instructions for use were written in English and espanol.  I was walking outside, down a dark city street.  I only had time to walk a mile before I had to go back, get the car, and drive to see the eclipse.  I looked up at the sky--I could see millions of stars.  I had reached the city limits and all that stretched out on the road before me were acres of fields and forest.  The streetlights had burned out or had never been put in, and no glare from the city reached me here.  Each patch of sky was like a galaxy.  I suddenly realized I wanted my star guide. I'd taken off my clogs at some point because it didn't make sense to walk in them, but now I turned around and hoped that, as I set off to run back to get the car and the star book, that I could find where I left my shoes.  I did.   
1719 20030703085607 The computer in the large office building was spewing out color images printed on top of important documents.  I suggested to the clerk that had been trying to print out her reports that she sew together all the giant color sheets into a flag.  But overall people were angry because we had, by accidentally sending our color images to these printers, caused the printers to run out of ink.  Someone had used home fragrance spray improperly, I believe to clean an ink jet head on the printer.  I was trapped in school; I had done all my work.  I wanted to ask permission to go to the library to write a research article, but instead I remembered that I had math homework.  I had forgotten how to do the math.  There was a family gathering.  My cousin Wesley was there, but as a two year old, with another small two year old beside him, trying to pet a small dog.  I went over towards them.  I pet the dog, too, and then I saw my dad sitting on a blanket, getting ready to watch an outdoor symphony.  My dad had some sort of "intestinal upset," he claimed, as he explained why he had to sit in a chair with ventilation.   Arie  had suddenly appeared on the blanket, right next to  Brandon .  Arie was telling Brandon to tell me about my friend Danielle's strange tendency to never refer to them by their first names, only as "your friend".  "But you don't know her," I began to say, when my dad grabbed my toe.    "Disgusting, Alesandra," my father said.  "You have some sort of foot fungus."  Everyone backed away from me, horrified.  Far later I was checking the light readings on a camera using a naked photo of my cousin, and writing out illustrated step-by-step directions on using the bread machine. 
1722 20030523084607 Walking back to a central school location, I encounter two scam artists as well as a friend who needs help to get back.  It is uncertain whether one of the people is a scam artist or a misunderstood philosopher.  It is nighttime and we are standing underneath one of the street's only lights.  I am looking for a ziploc bag I have, full of tickets with the number of a place that will come and evaluate my scamming acquaintance.  Through a sturdy set of double oak doors, down a long corridor, in an old high school audiorium, people from my high school are lined up to hold a fashion show/the prom.  There's a ridculous line--it wraps around the cavernous, dimly-lit room at the end of the corridor.  A skinny guy in a wifebeater is complaining angrily that the line isn't moving at all, and that he's hungry.  "You can always eat your shirt," I tell him.  "Full of fiber."  I find my friend Laura at the end of the line, but decide not to wait.  I can walk across the floor of a darkened room anytime, I reason; I don't need a crowd of people from high school watching me. I walk out the door, but out in the corridor people are coming in and out from trips acros the state.  Carla Schelmeyer from my high school has washed out her entire body in the restroom sink.  I'm wet, because I've been in the ocean, but she is sopping and dripping all over the hallway foor.  Somewhere I meet up with a woman from the National Youth Science Camp--it's my old acquaintance Fiona.  She's showing me old photos from camp; I've decided we need to have a reunion.    I'm back in the fashion show room.  I'm pulling out Laura and Karen Antonucci; we're leaving the show.  My head is shaved and I'm dressed like a man.  
1725 20030320104407 i remember now (a little)   Feral dogs were roaming around the back room of my parents' house.  A fat, sleek puppy and a mangy but friendly one were tagging alongside me.  We would never be able to start feeeding all the wild dogs in the house--they'd become dependent on us and there were so many of them.  There were large (3 feet by 2 feet) newsprint versions of our  Untitled publicity poster --separate images for the male and the female.  Only these were full body outlines.  They were like police chalk outlines--as I looked closer they turned to ash and only images of skeletons remained.   I was looking for spray paint because I was going to spray pain "alloy" running up their torso in black and white.  I couldn't find any black spray paint in the back room--only several cans of blue, red, and red-purple spray paint, in Communist China issued army green spray paint bottles.  I saw a cap for black spray paint, but it turned out to be attached to a miner's hat of my father's.  I was in a wood-panelled room I'd never beeen in--a posh hotel or university conference room.  There was a floor-to-ceiling glass window on the far end--I could see the sails of the house next door billowing in the wind.  The whole side of the house--all four wooden stories of it--was battened down with rich  maroon and royal blue madras plaid.  It billowed in the wind and for a moment I could see the four external decks, covered in wooden furniture made of twigs, lush tropical plants.  The sunlight was dappled across the house; it was summer.  My sisters came in with a puppy--the same puppy I'd seen mangy and hungry in my parents' house. "That's right, love him," my sis Kate said as I bent down to pet him.  
1732 20030711092408 -the bakery where Bryce worked; the darkened storefront.  my entry and  the woman, a customer, close behind.  the question of credit for the  free pretzel--if she returned that which she got free, could she get a  refund for it? the manager decides, ultimately.  -the tour of the city with the future city planners.  -the old city: streets of hills and old shops and buildings.  European  architecture, hot and muggy like New Orleans but grey like Long Island,  today.  -the library.  waiting for everyone to be ready.  the people we are  waiting for have all gone mad; they are walkign around like zombies or  willfully running away from us, like two-year-olds.  the tall person in  the twelve-foot high Wilbur the pig costume, scrambling along the thin  railing that separates the second-story children's room from the void  of the circular stairs, one trotter close upon the other.  -the streets, called circuses.  the young woman with her entourage  asking for directions.  I cannot answer, for I am at an intersection  and traffic has started moving.  -my Nanny, drinking a drink and eating cornbread.  my Pop-Pop is  sitting across from her.  He reaches out his hand to grab my Nanny's  drink and she slaps his wrist.  "Ask for it, Joe, ask for it," she  says.  My Pop-Pop starts mumbling unitelligible like Frankenstein.   Then he begins to say single words that seem to issue from his stomach,  from a hole undergraound far away, from a man who has seen no one and  talked to nothing for over forty years.  "Stone ground corn," he says,  and something else.  My Nanny refuses to give him any drink.  "Use your  brain," she says.  "The muscles are all there," my Pop-Pop says.  "They just don't work  anymore."

The house was glowing with light and I thought to myself that we would need to get curtains so that no one would know that we were working there.  Corie and Erin pulled up in a white van to my parents' house. I almost just missed them because I was going to try to catch Paul Garritano at his band practice. Earlier I tlaked with Jay Freeman and he made me laugh and laugh.  We were looking for a chair that I wanted to sell. It wound up being inside a lingerie shop, so Mike Wells and Daniel Boudon (?) and I had to put away the underwear and bras that the employees had already stacked on top of it. Just a few minutes earlier some LA music produceer type whom we had recently met came in to let me know that he had purchased some work of art that I was selling. It was a nest, but I didn't think that it had been mine.  Photos inside my sketchbook had solarized themselves to the page. They made the photographic images stand out in stark black and white, with intereting texture and pattern. Mike Wells was experimenting with them. Someone was talking about Alex Budnitz.  A wedding invitation from Karen Hoff, Nashville real estate agent. I didn't understand if the invitation was a bulk mail solicitation but finally I figured out that we were actually invited. The wedding would be a dramatic reenactment of the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe. Our names kept changing on the multiple envelopes inside.  The madrigal singing group?  A wall of sound, solid to the touch and resonant. 
1763 20060120111608 I had captured a large spider that was spitting venom.  It had bitten me with a tiny lit bit of poison -- not enough to truly injure me, but enough to hurt. I trapped the spider beneath a glass mason jar and could see the condensation collect on the sides of the glass.  This was because the spider was actually puffing itself up with poison.  The effect was somewhat like one of those frogs that puff out their chest and throat. The body seemed moist, like an amphibian's, glistening with poison.  I made the mistake of placing the spider over a heating grate.  It dropped down through the bars of the grate and down a long tunnel that ended somewhere near the bottom of the building. I'd have to deal with it sometime again.   There was a home beneath a mountain and we were going there out of some vague sense of danger.  It wasn't any safer, really, and if danger struck we would actually be trapped there.  The rooms were dark and brown, with peeling yellow wallpaper, but the overall effect was not disgusting, only very antique.  At some point I was yelling at my sister Kate for spending too much money.    In a room with one wall completely open to the outside, very tropical feeling, my cousin or a friend was taking out all the white gumballs in one of those 25-cent machines that rolls the gumball down a long spiralling plastic track.  They were saving these either for my cousin Meg or my sister Sarah.  I was given some to hold but there were too many for my hand so some wound up spilling, turning into rolling oranges as they went across the floor.  We had to feed a spider something ... a large, hairy coconut that looked like an orangutan's head?  some bananas? (though I think that was the only thing they had eaten all day).   
1766 20030414012808 dream of 4/13  Looking thru sis Kate's room for clothes--I thought at first I was searching for school clothes but it turned out to be for some family function.  I was looking for the old armoire I used to think was bottomless and backless and through which I could slip through into another land if I pressed hard enough.    In the bottom of the armoire were tee-shirts that we'd started painting during some family craft day a long time ago.  Sketches my mother had made, of strange organic shapes speared by poles, were down there, too.  Sonny and Javier, my old students, were in the hallway of my parents' house, outside sis Kate's room, and they saw me in my towel headed for the shower.  They were acting incorrigible.    I didn't have time to shower.  Rick's dad wanted to go.  Everyone was gathering downstairs, at the foot of a curving staircase in a house I have never seen before.  I snubbed Rick's dad as I passed him on my way upstairs to find something else to wear.  Everyone had forgotten about Kate, who was supposed to come too.  She was showering upstairs and everyone was ready to leave without her.    Earlier, I was walking with my mom, my dad, and their tall friend Amy Simrell.  We were talking about the women who'd accompanied them on their expedition to Guatemala--the women who'd hoed down wild basil groves to plant oak trees--over and over again because the oak trees wouldn't root.  There was an enormous stand of still-bare sycamore trees to our right, atop a hill.  My mom was talking about the woman who'd run that part of the expedition.  My mom had gotten a black sweater from her--the woman had read/interpreted  The Catcher in the Rye  as a continuation of and a commentary on  The Republic  (and vice versa).   
1767 20060205155608 Woke up screaming twice because Kate on the phone kept telling me Sarah had=  died.  On the streets of New York I tried to convince doctors telepathical= ly to bring her back to life.  At some Brooklyn family member's house, with=  the raised flocked wallpaper and the heavy wooden furniture, sitting at th= e table with its pad to prevent stains and heat marks, the filmy yellow-ora= nge light of seventies photos suffusing everything, talking with my Aunt Fa= nny and the third, unknown sister, in English and colloquial Italian, reali= zing that she was not backwards as everyone had suspected, but that no one = had ever spoken her language.  Later walking with her past those New York C= ity streets she'd never been able to walk alone, passing by the street corn= er where hundreds of cats gathered.  Some owners trained their cats to stan= d on their hindlegs to greet their children when they got off school and ca= me through the park, and some cats on their hindlegs even wore long belted = jackets and carried hand bags to accentuate their resemblance to fancy Edwa= rdian ladies.  How my Aunt Fanny and I loved to see these animals.  Where was the land we walked through, parklike, the wilderness area at the back of all my dreams, the outer almost unmapped territory of sleep, big boulders with the waterfalls running between them and the high trails.  We were here again walking over the bridges washed away by spring rains rebuilt with slabs of hewn wood and further on they were logging and milling logwood for dye.  I don't really remember this dream only the feeling of being outside, somewhere at the edge of something else, striving in sleep to regain entrance to the wild uncharted land, put aside untouched, all of ours heritage. 
1771 20031212022808 where the fuck was i looking?   The sea, enormous, swollen with storms.  The waves as high as barns.  I was walking along the one remaining spit of land, a narrow tract of sand as wide as a two lane road, the ocean billowing on either side of me.  A war was going on, I realized suddenly, as the jetliners began careening into the waves.  I wanted desperately for them to land on shore but they dove into the water, sinking almost instantly.  Other planes, crop dusters and prop planes, were zooming in low now too, and these landed on the strip of land, to the cheers of the thousands of uniformed officers now standing on both sides of the sand bar, waving flags and embracing one another.  Mayor Bloomberg was there, but I could not recognize him.  He had the face of a charismatic but easily interchangeable movie actor; he was warmly shaking the hands of the people getting off the planes.  The waves swept above us, higher and higher.  My Nanny walking with me.  I supported her as she walked over stairs, and escorted her back down and around a bronze statue she tried to scramble over.  I was happy when I relaized that I could give her her Christmas present in person.  A classroom where I sang alto with the few remaining students, all the while trying to construct a 3-D folding box puzzle.  A scraggle-haired bearded man (a social worker who had trained as a lawyer) sitting next to a fat and beautiful older woman, dripping with costume jewelery and aging hippie finery.  THey were making a documentary on lawyers outside the law practice.    Rick grew mad at me when I tried to undress in my parents' side yard, where there was an outdoor shower.  A daft pubescent cousin had shown up, making me uncomfortable in my half-nakedness, as well.  
1783 20060510111808 was the blamey's hosue burning?  no, just filled with light.  there was a large house now where the garage used to be.  david guzzetta had fixed it up nicely and now aunt ginny and her family, dressed in late forties clothes, were coming to visit.  "it's just like my dream," i said to myself, "my dream where david moves in."  bil breyer made a page on the plowhaus wiki: "i'd respond to you about my favorite song if anyone ever checked the plowhaus wiki".  i found this an obnoxious statement.  kate wanted to draw the cherry blossoms before they all fell to the ground but they were piling up thick and fast like pink snow.  we were out on a grassy set of hills that was nowhere but perhaps upstate.  the hills were full of blossoming trees and the sky was gold-salmon and shimmering like after rain when the sun breaks through just before setting.  it made me feel trembling all over and i wanted to run.  kate and i were running from tree to tree trying to find the perfect blossoms.  i thought i saw some but they were tiny dogwoods -- and then i saw some other delicate blossoms, single ones, not the pink powderpuff ornamental cherries but more delicate.  we ran allt he way to where kate's school was.  she needed the blossoms for a paper she would write that evening, due tomorrow.  we were running and running and laughing so fast we felt like flying.  we almost careened into one older woman but she didn't mind at all.  she knew how happy we were and what it was like to feel that way when the day was ending and everything was rose-gold.  but a professor type saw us and marched us downstairs into a classroom and made us sit.  didn't he know i was already way out of school i wondered as i looked at the feet of people around me, stuck to the floor.   
1805 20030707075007 in which i have a dream that could easily have happened in real life  In the night in downtown Nashville just along the riverfront by the old Shelby Street Bridge was a wall where people could write their messages about upcoming events.  It was completely covered with these written messages.  We were hanging posters for an art show coming up.  We needed cardboard boxes as well, so we picked up some from an alley and ducked into a liquor store to find more.  Somehow we ended up in an upscale supermarket.  While I was in there I figured I could buy dried cranberries and cashews, since for some reason I had to bring them to the show.  The prices were ridiculous.  People were milling around sneaking gobs of frosting off the large fancy cakes on display in the bulk foods section.    Suddenly a man addressed us all.  "Have you all seen the movie  Wonder Woman ?" he asked.  People shook their heads or ignored him, but he went on talking.  It was a worthwile movie to see, he explained, not only for its special effects and good acting, but because there was an interesting message.  I realized it was our friend Nick talking.  I was so happy to see him, I jumped up and hugged him.  I glimpsed my Nanny in another aisle, talking loudly to another patron.  "I'm not much of a fan of that neo-80s stuff," she said, referring to her politics, and the other person agreed.  But I didn't think that was the case.  I saw my sisters Sarah and Kate sitting at a high table, eating some sort of snack with some friends.  They called me over and kept getting mad when I took my sweeet time to get over there.   Earlier, my dad and I got in a fight because I didn't have a rain slicker to take a walk with him in the rain.  Someone had given me a list of reasons to keep recording my dreams.   
1805 20061118093014 just by looking at the machine i got a free diet cherry coke. it rolled out of the vending machine as though my magic.    in a house understood to be sean siple's house.  there were snacks everywhere, but i accidentally picked up a pile of dry dog food that had gone soggy and expanded, thinking it was a cookie.  disgusted, i threw it down on the floor.  sean was talking about the changes brought on by having children.  i realize that i have missed danielle's phone call, but when i pick upt he phone to talk she is laying with me in what i realize is the room off the kitchen in rick's old cabin, but with betternatural light.  danielle must go for a bit but we promise to call each other right back.  but when i call back a little later she is just about to grab red and green sushi with steve.  she says she will call in a matter of minutes.  she knows i need someone to talk to.  i'm setting off the street and i'm in a residential area right alongside a parkway, fels like i am in one of the five boroughs.  i walk into a house -- it's my old roommate camie's house, i realize.  i take a few cookies from where they are baking and perhaps i am talking with danielle on the phone here. when i go to leave i realize camie has arrived with some co-workers.  they are cooking some dinner.  it's been a long time since i've seen camie, so i come back in to say hello.  but camie is distant and cold, like i'd hurt or disappointed her badly and she'd written me off a long time ago.  i am abashed and go outside into the night, but when i get out i realize i've left the portable phone inside camie's house.  later i am driving my car fast up the dark street with a park to my right.  i almost hit a pedestrian.  there are men coming down the street, day laborers just getting off work.  
1812 20060809085208 I walked and walked through various shopping mall shops, looking for a spot to change into my bathing suit.  In one tiny room between boutiques, in a space that used to be a shotgun Chinese or sub sandwhich restaurant, I saw the parents of a former student.  I hadn't realized it, but I was invited to this version (there had been an earlier one as well) of their son's birthday party.    My Nanny was playing piano as people sang and though she was disapproving of my cousin Collin's rock star stylings of a certain 80s hair rock ditty, we loudly applauded a job well done.  I was taking things out of a hallway closet down the room from where my family was gathered.  Someone (my dad?) mentioned something about how much energy was utilized in my Nanny being on all the time; as they said this I pulled nests and lace out of an old and delicate canvas bag with an old William Morris like Barnes and Nobles design on the cover.  Danielle was walking in to the post office as I was about to mail a letter.  It was 5 p.m. and we were supposed ot meet at 5:30, so I had thought we might see each other there.  It was New York City and the post office was in a big train terminal with old marble walls.  It was dingy and beautiful, but the post office itself was very small and there was a customer behind the counter with her son, about three or four, holding him while she sorted out the checks she was having the post office employees deposit.  I was mailing a letter and I looked down at the counter to see a taped sign put together on someone's desktop computer: "Things We Accept: LAUGH!" and I came to realize it was an advertisement for some lady who would come to your house and clean and tell jokes, though at first I had thought it was a reminder for postal patrons to actually be civil.  
1844 20060503104211 Bryce's shop, but not.  the beautiful, crudely drawn murals by the hip-hop mogul who would turnt he rest of the shop into a secret underground dance haven.  but what was this in back, where i was sneaking around unknown?  this was part of a building that i had seen in other dreams and that i knew went on undendingly, room after subterrenean room.  franne lee was coming to the party.  i had to get away!  but i could not.  she was clinging to my leg and talking on and on.  much later i am back in this same shop area.  only now i am an adolescent boy with two other boys.  we are on bikes and we are investigating the mysetrious disappearance of our friend.  we hop behind the door of a garage and peer out.  there is the large group, the bicycle gang, peddling along, and there is our friend in front, seemingly dead with his eyes bugged out in front of him, lids and mouth wide open.  but i know that he is just stunned and will wake up soon, but hten they will kill him.  we have no time to lose.  but we are now locked int eh garage.  somehow we get out.  we chase the gang.  really we are to be powerless on our small bikes -- one of us just on a foot-powered scooter.  i see or friend nowhere and i am worried that they have drowned him in the creek and buried him in a shallow grave along the bank.  but i plead with some of the gang members anyway.  one is kevin rangel, my old student, and his older brother.  i try to tell the older brother how he can help kevin to have a better life.  i offer another girl, a young version of katie neil, my hair clip.  at first she refuses it, saying she does not want to touch anything that's been on my head but i persist in offering it, tell her she can put it in boiling water.    earlier the bus-boat with the party-going nashville musicians and the pool in the way way back.
1845 20060329082408 The two alarms going off were to remind us of two different strands of secret language that we needed to be attuned to.  When one ended the other would begin so that we would be sure to listen.  I didn't knwo what day it was but it didn't matter -- I had to wake up no matter what. Ginny had showed up downstairs and was calling up to Sarah and me to wake up.  She thought we were lazy because we were still sleeping (me especially; Sarah had the explanation of a broken back), but in reality we had gone to bed just a few hours before, staying up working on projects.  I jumped out of bed and went downstairs to meet Ginny.  She was standing by the fridge in our kitchen, wearing a white ribbed tanktop and a long apron from Chik-fil-A and funny ballooing clown pants.  Somehow my sister Sarah had helped her get into this outfit.  We laughed and laughed.    The kitchen was kind of essy and I felt a little embarrassed.  From around the corner came another woman and Ginny said, "Here's your Grandma Green."  Indeed, it did look like Grandma Green, but it also looked like Aunt Maddy.  I sat and talked with her at the kitchen table.  "Did you get a chance to vacuum?" she asked.  "Actually --" I started.  "Or to ..."  -- she mentioned another chore I cannot remember.    "Well, it's embarrassing ," I said, "but I actually hate vaccuming and I'm always trying to get out of doing housework if possible.  I understand the value of a clean house but the grating thing is that it always needs to be done.  I know it's something like breathing or seeing, but I just ..."  "And no one ever calls," Aunt Maddy / Grandma Green said quietly.  I could tell that she meant it.  It was a meditation of sorts.  I was telling her about Melissa's graduation from nursing school and she got a little upset because she hadn't heard about it. 
1850 20060208080607 Preparing a big vat of hot rocks to boil clothes in.    Talking with my dad, trying to apply leave-in conditioner to my hair, which had grown very long.  In the outside auience of folding chairs, at the very back sat three grandmas from the mid-west or south.  They were our grandmas though we ahdn't known about them until recently, and each had on a long fleece nightshirt with a Looney Tunes character face and the name of one of their grandchildren airbrushed on it.  One had "Sass" (not Sarah) and another had "Sarah" with a picture of Tweety and another had a name I cannot remember.  Someone explained to me how I had been performing this one yoga posture, the backward bend or supine vajrasana, incorrectly.    Earlier, I dreamt that we had gone into my aunt Kathy's house to escape from a tornado that threatened us on a hillside.  But while everyone remained downstairs in the cellar I ran upstairs to use the bathroom, and maybe also to do one other thing, to explore the house which seemed strange and old, with thick layers of wallpaper upon the walls.  But when I made my way to the stairs I paused to look out the window and I saw that strong winds were blowing the trees almost to the ground.  Wind was blowing through the window I looked through and whistling loud and eerily like singing.  Then I heard the rush of wind loud like a train whistle or an air-raid siren and I knew that the tornado was coming directly in our path.  I was trying to run down the steps but the wind was so strong that I could hardly run.  I was holding the banister trying to get down to safety and the wind was knocking me back almost parallel to the floor.  I somehow made it down and sat down next to Hilda Fehd.  Then we realized that the entire house had blown away and everything we owned had been lost, but that we were all safe.   
1856 20030818220808 dream of 8/18  What happened to you, dream of this morning?  All I remember of you is my aunt Gin standing in front of the wooden island in her old kitchen in Massachussetts.  dream of 8/17  Sis Sarah was descending stairs deciding what she would study and what she would be. She was going to business school.  My grandpa Bellos was on the winding stairway, looking as he did when he graduated Worcester Tech.  His eyes were wild and ice blue, and his face was young but his body was old.  He was a choice that Sarah might make, standing on the landing midway between floors, but he was hidden out of her sight.  Then Sass was speeding down the highway.  I saw her pass me, tried to warn = her to slow down, but she was moving too quickly, cutting off people from b= oth lanes.  She cut off the inevitable police officer and then he cut her o= ff, getting in front of her and forcing her to slow down, then zipping behi= nd her to pull her over.  I had driven on ahead by this point, but I pulled=  over and walked over to where Sass was tearfully trying to explain why she=  was speeding.  I kept cutting off Sarah and the officer to explain what ha= d happened--Sass was on her way back to school; she needed to get there on = time; could the officer be lenient just this once; I would drive next to Sa= rah and keep her speed in check.  But the officer wasn't buying it.  He wal= ked away to get his ticket book and I was left talking with a little old la= dy.  The highway had walls now; it was a corridor like the main hallway of = my elementary school.  The old lady left and the police officer came back, = handing Sarah her ticket.  The euonymous branches I had planted were brown and dead, so I turned it around to chop it up.  But when we chopped it at its base, the base sprung up green.  So I planted it that way up, and it grew.
1857 20030515031608 dream of 5/13  The Sea of Galilee had dried up, and we had to journey across its bed on foot, on our way to build a cathedral.  I'd left little icons along the way indicating what we needed--paint, stained glass.  I was reading a section about the apostles in a book on that was a translation of the Greek version of the New Testament.  In my notes in the margin I'd put one whole section in brackets and written in red pen next to it: "Gaby".  In a large, vaguely concrete room, a lot of little kids were romping around. Some had needed to passs a physical challenge in order to get to stay there.  In a more furnished room in back of the concrete one, a bunch of kids hung out in cribs and sleeping quarters, waiting for an adult to come in and carry them out of the room to go to bed.  On a car ride somewhere, I was trying to explain to Lana, Rick's mom, my great love for magical realism, and why I loved Latin American writing.  My mom was driving me in El Valle.  On the edge of town somewhere, just before the highway turned into a ribbon steaking through farm and flatland, she was putting on lipstick at a stoplight.  The light was green and she was not going.  An SUV behind us put on its flashers and siren.  At first I thought it was just to let others go by, but then the SUV kept following us down a side street.    It was a cop, a middle aged, silvery blond woman who opened the driver's side door and sat next to my mom. The cop admonished my mom--"I gave you four warnings [honking, flashing lights, etc.]...no matter how beautiful you are, you still have to follow traffic rules."  My mom was impassive.  My mom really did look very pretty, I thought, but I also thought the cop was coming on especially harsh because she liked my mom.   At soem point I started talking about Mr. and Mrs. Hall and how much I admired them. 
1861 20030905013208 9/3 I was appearing in two plays, but I was double-booked.  One play's opening night was next weekend--the other play's opening night was the next weekend.  But both plays continued to run for several weeks after their opening nights.  I didn't know what to do.  The brakes were failing on our car.  We were at a crossroads about to start a long journey.  I waited outside the Untitled meeting.  I was late, and it was night.  I was supposed to take notes, but I was embarrassed to walk in late.  Two people from the publicity committee, both philosophers, were gathering their thoughts inside an old Chrysler LeBaron.  I decided to walk in with them, so I got in the car to wait with them.  One was clutching a book by Spinoza, the other a book by Hume.  Inside the meeting ridiculous people were interfering with the self-important presentations of two serious people.  A roomful of mockers was combatting the presenters every attempt to explain and debate different forms of government.  9/4 At the crossroads, at night.  The landscape of open fields and overpasses.  Further back, down the road behind me, the print shop.  I saw Brandon's car go by, and I was suddenly embarrassed to be outside. I ran back to the shop, but I forgot to lock the door.  I was in the back with the Hispanic women, dancing.  Then I walked back to the main room, where the shop apparatus stood on a wooden stage, as though on an island.  People were coming in the main door--it seemed there was going to be a show or a dance up on the stage.  Brandon came in along with another man.  "You cannot be here," I told him, pleading.  "You need to go.  Go through the back door"--I pointed back behind the stage.  And then when I lost sight of him my heart sank.   Later on downstairs, the man who always hung out there needed extras for a film.  He had a dark secret. 
1866 20061102085007 mexico was shaped like a v-shaped room, a scalene triangle, or at least to cross over you entered a place like this.  on one side of the line were people with white tongues and on the other people with red tongues.  fine filaments like spider's silk connected everything in the world in one web.  if you drove on the edge of this nowhere land strange combinations of paved and unmaintained roads awaited you, through arroyo style scrub and drainage ditches and washes and paths.  It was a maze of paths and the goal was not to get anywhere in particular so I just drove and walked aorund.  much later in and out of sleep i looked through the window in the attic of my parents' house and saw that although midday and sunny, frost was collecting around a one layer stack of yellow maple leaves centered on the skylight.  The water around them began to crystallize.  I looked outside and the tips of the bamboo began to be stiffened and immobilized by ice.  I ran to get Sarah to tell her we had to go to the garden and harvest basil.  OUtside in late sunlight at the college campus I looked to see a youth driving a car fast around the parking lot.  he scared a cat that was blue and purple, not garish but subtle, a work of breeding.  the cat had only a short stump tail.  i called it over to where sarah and i were standing on grass.  the cat came over.  he was a little skittish but affectionate.  the guy in the car came by again and revving his engine drove up on the grass, scaring away the cat and almost hitting it and us.  i got his license plate number, an arizona plate with two letters and then a digit, then a digit and two letters.  i called over the cat again.  the youth in the car would come back.  i listed all the things that might happen from a car accident: "damaged car, damaged highway, broken bones, broken bones, broken bones". 
1916 20030324101807 Driving down a large highway, I saw part of a jet ski.  Then I saw a large snowboarding boot, standing straight up in th road.  Then I saw another boot, and a helmet, and a pile of clothes.  I was swerving to avoid all these things.  Then I realized they must be the remains of bodies.  I was really upset.  Mounds of rubble were everywhere.  I kept seeing more jetski parts, more clothing, more boots.  A man was standing next to a large dump truck, waving a flag to direct people around it--there wasn't much room to pass it on either side, however.  It was sweeping up rubble and whatever remained of these grisly accidents.  I'd abandoned my car.  I was running down a cobblestone street with some children.  Then we were inside a covered market with many small shops.  Vivek Krishna, the first chair violinist from my high school, was teaching me how to turn my spelunkers helmet back into the scooter it had once been.  I was about to go back to rejoin my family for a brief visit.  He told me that I should probably shave my legs before I went down to see them.  There was a deli-style market with all sorts of ethnic foods.  There were huge plates of different dried fruits--apricots, prunes, dates, and some different fruit pastes--for some sort of festival.  Then my dad was ordering a large hollowed out  pan dulce  (it was more like a mollete, really, but whatever).    Inside was supposed to be cottage cheese filling--but really it was only about a teaspoon or so, and the rolls were fairly large, New York City deli muffin size.  My dad was asking for chili and cheese, a la Frito Pie, on top of one of his orders (he'd gotten two).  But the lady behind the counter said that since the breads were cased in a plastic clamshell contraption, not even large enough to hold them, she couldn't pour filling into them, despite the large amount of hollowed out space inside the pan dulce.     
1918 20030509093007 I dreamt  "The Witch of Coos" , by Robert Frost.  Then I dreamt that my Aunt Barbara's house was very messy, as ours is right now--piles of laundry and books and papers everywhere.  My sister Sarah was shaking her head at it, but I said, "It's juat because we're here."  The arrival at science camp--I was helping to coordinate the planefuls and busloads of adults and teenagers descending on the open field for science camp.  Boys with very thick wire-rimmed coke-bottle glasses kept approaching me.  The harp player from our orchestra was flitting around, the recipient of many graduation gifts.    At some point earlier I was trapped with a bunch of other people behind a large mound of snow--four or five feet of it, but the sun out on us, the snow dazzling blue and white.  I threw Kate onto the snow so she could make her way through it to find the bathroom.  Katie Palamara from my high school was making numerous trips to the restroom.  I thought maybe she was sick.  Rick was sitting in the back of the Malibu with a large stylish woman who was interviewing him for a new job. I almost locked my keys up in the back of the trunk, along with my knapsack. I was wearing a ridiculous outfit--a pale turquoise blue skirt of sweatshirt material, turquoise blue striped leggings, and a pastel striped rainbow shirt on a bank of turquoise blue.  "I love dressing like the eighties," I said.  Later I was separating out recycling for my godmother MB.  I kept forgetting that I could put in some plastics.  In my dream I tried to remember my dream and could not.  I realized I was a man, a singer-songwriter who had only recently begun his career.  I'd started just nine months ago, and sung for three months with great success.  Then something traumatic had happened and for six months I had been performing silently.  Because I had not talked for so long, it was hard to remember my dreams in words.  
1928 20030521110007 Through the dales endlessly, high sudden hills and deep ridges like my old dreams of goblinland.  At first it is sunset, the sort that comes suddenly in hilly places--first the sun high enough in the sky to gild everything in warm gold--then suddenly its drop beneath the crest of sharp hills, the sudden gathering dusk, only the faintest glow of warm fire behind the hills' penumbra.  Everywhere there is water; it's spring and the high hills are flooding, water cascading in mountain streams, ripping great and small gulches alike, making rapids and waterfalls as it swirls down hillsides.  My sister Kate is out walking ahead of us, getting her feet wet. I'm running through the streams barefoot--then I'm jumping over them because they are too deep and wild to ford.  "Senza zapatos?"  someone asks, but I ignore him.  There's something I should be walking towards, just over the crest of the hill--and yet I know if I came to the crest of that one what I'm looking for would lie just over the next.  It's the horizon I'm pursuing, really, and despite the height of any one of these hills I still can't glimpse it.  It's night and we need to get back, off the wild hillside.   Howard  is with us, walking, and we've got to get Rick home, somehow.  We're scrambling like goats up the almost vertical rise. There's a Mexican/spicy chicken place halfway up, just barely open, closing up for the night, the tables for two only turned upside down and stacked up neatly outside the door.  Rick needs to eat--he gets some spicy chicken and we start off walking again.  I'd seen his wallet tossed on the ground alongside some ketchup packets--when I catch up to him and Howard I ask Rick if he's dropped it.  When he says yes I offer to run back and grab it for him.  It's full night now, no light or stars except the solitary lonely glow of the fluorescent porch light on the spicy chicken place.  I love the night. 
1933 20060111083209 Tuva ASSR   After I had dropped off Laura and her friend on foot downtown near the Gaylord Auditorium, I ran back on foot.  The skyline of the city had changed here and there were tall brick buildings with narrow alleyways between them, as in an old European city.  I heard from behind me the noise of sobbing.  I looked back and, walking beneath me on another level of the city street, a bearded heavyset man in his sixties walked next to and comforted an overweight, sobbing lady.  They were both crying.  Behind them a young figure was walking (with hands on both their shoulders?).  I tried to hear what they were saying.  "We are so sad, we are burdened," said the man in Russian.  "All has happened, all has taken place," he said.    I tried calling down to them in Russian: "I'm sorry too," I said.    "What?" the old man said.  "Slushaet!" -- the one word of intelligible Russian I actually heard in the dream.  "Slushaet," he said again. "Listen.  We are sad and sorry."  "I'm sad, I'm sorry," I said in English.  "I'm sad for you."  "It is for the 11th of October we are sad," said the man to his young companion, or to the air.  I understood by this that they wept for the aftermath of the Revolution.  In my dream the dates of October 11th and January 11th existed coterminously.  In my dream I struggled to recall this part of my dream to recount to others.  I ran back to tell them but they were busy with a reality-tv like composite flashback of a number of going-away parties and a few games of charades.   Earlier Olga from Moscow walked through the enclosed gardens and manicured quares of the city or the university with me.  Some mail order service had sent us an extraneous shipment of candy lozenges.  The cost was $16 per pund, and there were about 32 - 40 pieces per pound.  I was trying to figure out what kind of margin we could make selling these, and whether it was worthwhile even to try. 
1937 20030517083407 The suspension, as in solid space   A horrible storm was coming, and my mom and sisters and I were driving through it, trying to get to my Nannay's.  Long Island has become deserted.  We'd glimpse some cars occassionally, but like us, they's be struggling to keep on the road in the face of seventy mile-an-hour winds, debris falling everywhere, a dusty unnatural twilight brought on by the low clouds and the stuff in the air.  At some point I was out of the car and walking on foot to get somewhere.  High over the city I was walking, on the worn out sheet iron of a railway trestle.  The trestle I was walking on was more of an observation post, really, and an overpass/underpass.  Down below was a switching station for freight trains.  I was leaning over to watch the trains as they pulled up and rearranged themselves.    The metal of the trestle was worn through in many places, and although I had often walked this way before, without fear, I was suddenly scared that I would fall through some of the bigger holes--some as wide a two feet.  I walked towards the far edge, where there was a guardrail.  Suspended in the air, some feet below on my left hand side, a Salvation Army style thrift shop hung in space.  A man was looking through women's long silk nighties.  I pegged him for a cross dresser.  I was trying to see, as I kept walking, if they had any interesting size nin shoes. All of hte little shoes were awesome, as they were from little old ladies wardrobe collections of the 1940s, '50s, and '60s.  But the bigger the shoe size got, the uglier and more recent the shoes.  I had a nightmare, too, in the middle of the night when the thunderstorms came.  But now I can remember only a few things--a beuatiful woman standing by a murky rock pool, filled with still water, in a mountainside resort/dance hall, complaining to her boyfriend the owner of the club that he was building a mosquito paradise.  
1937 20060621074608 Cris Alonso was having a baby and we were all assisting at the birth.  There was a grass alleyway between the houses .  This was different than the paved alleyway behind houses further down the road.  One of the chief differences was that people started claiming part of the commmunal space for their own, not in a selfish way, but keeping it clean, planting useful plants, helping to tend to other people's plots as well.  The king of Nepal was changing his will.  He had already ripped off a portion of the cereal box back it was printed on, thus taking off two of his sons.  Now only three children remained on the will.  I was debating with my mom the usefulness of receiving the money specified in the will, an annual sum of somewhere around $10,000.  I thought it would be possible to go to Nepal and do good work there but my mom tended to disagree.  We were looking at the map with its shape-shifting countries. The old man was changing his will, it turned out, because he no longer had any money to give away -- he had been electd or appointed president last year, but had to finance his own time in office completely.  y dad had a funny letter to Ernestino Claudino.  This was the same person as Paul Rosa.  Back when a small garden was growing next to the wall I was leaning over, someone had found it easier to weed regularly.  My mom was having an art show and wanted us to help organize it.  I had committed myself to helping many people, including one girl who looked like Crystal Stanscheit (I would help her with her homework).  I didn't actually have time to do all this so I was relieved when the girl had to go home.  I pulled out one long twig with a sharpened end and a hydra-looking set of branches.  It was my protection against someone maniacal who was coming in.  I was trying to put Ubu the cat into a hamock with another person, but it wound up being challenging just to get Ubu in completely. 
1955 20060326072607 Somehow reenacting an ancient cycle in which we were all simply players driving the wheel of the seasons.   There was no way to make things work and yet everyone was trying simply out of hope.  I drove my car many miles until the city melted away and I was in the rural detrius of what used to be a busy off-highway stop.  There was a Kroger in what seemed to be a gas station with high shelters for trucks (as most do). I went inside to get hte things on my om's list.  I glanced at the clock as I camein and saw 9:25 p.m.  I realized that I would belate for returning totown to meet upwiht Franne toplay quartets.  Iwanted to call her but I wasn't sure where I couldfind a phone.   I went to get a cart and nearly collided with an elegantly dressed older woman who smiled graciously, like someone whohas always had money, when I moved to the side and let her pass with an apology.  I found two pieces of jewelry on the floor underneath the counter on which to set down bundles and reading material.  One was a plastic blue clip-on earring and earlier I had found a beautiful and older early cast plastic pin in navy blue, a model of an old amulet.  Mom's list was very strange and in addition to staple food stuff she had included a whole section on jewelry.  There was a whole case of jewelry just past the front registers.  Some of it was resale stuff.  My mom had written  lemon SALT  necklaces -shell ring -ash and bone  There was more but I cannot remember.  Butnone of the items she requested were in the jewelry case.  I went over to look at hte quicksale jewelry.  There were a bunch of shell necklaces reduced with an orange fluorescent price tag to 75 cents.  Later we were fishingin the air with beautiful tiny fly fishing lures, but this would unfortunately make my dadangry.  One Grandaddy song in my head as I awoke: Gentle Spike Resort?  Clack clack clack.  Or maybe it was - won't somebody please / take away my keys ...  
1965 20060509073608 The video performance of the man and his younger selves.  "Time Lapse Youth to Age" or something was the title.  We looked at black and white photos at first, taken at very varied stages of life (two as a small child, one as a full grown man) superimposed one after the other. Slowly I realized that the man moved through a sequence of poses -- laying down to sitting up to standing to laying down again, corresponding to the static position of each photo.  But the images were no longer still photos, but rather the man moving through the positions in a repetitive dance.  I thought of rituals of birth and death and rebirth as the man lay down and then got up again; that is, I thought about how cultures represent these processes.  The man's face was changing and now we no longer saw the soft and unwrinkled face of youth but his older, sterner face.  Now that face too got older and older but the unceasing movement continued.  Then the man's motions got smaller and you could see that he was continuing these motions but in a box. There was a dog beside him now, a german shepherd.  He gave the dog one last reassuring pat.  Then from above his son, another incarnation of his younger self, began throwing dirt over what we relaized was his grave.  The man's motions stopped but he was not completely still, just resting his hand on the dog, who was trembling, as earth fell on them and the light grew darker and darker.  Then one saw the top of the grave and the shiny black shoes of the son jumping up and down on it to firm it up.  The giant mechanized cross appeared, gothic and multi-parted, half in the grave and half out.  Trying to hang with Karen Kinslow.  She had given Erin Hidalgo (nee Wilder) a "nose job", but by Karen's own account it was "really unsuccessful".  Wagner's opera playing very loudly outside the bar-like area where I was gathering materials and eavesdropping on other's converstations, wishing I was part of them. 
1980 20030817032207 dream of 8/16  Nick Szydlowski and I were roaming through a series of strip mall restaurants, trying to find the one we had gone to once before, Tazza. When we finally found it, a couple was sitting down behind a wood panelled alcove, and several waiters were busy serving classily-presented dinner dishes.  One waiter was setting down a silver tray of chocolate covered mints--they looked kind of like Thin Mints, with actual sprays of mint tucked into the chocolate coating.  Nick went to grab two mints, thinking them complimentay, but withdrew his hand sharply, uch chagrined, when he learned they were part of the diners' dinner order.  In another room a busdriver sat with her tiny tiny baby, no bigger than a marmoset.  "I only get to see her half the year," the bus driver said as she held her close.  The baby, already a year, was making faces at me and trying to talk in sign language.    In the same room, we attempted a word puzzle--we had to arrange six letters to make the longest word we could.  Nick solved the puzzle: "Manitoba," he said.  I thought it was strange that our fina word had more letters than we were initially alloted, but in the dream it worked out.  Our discovery of this word gave us great power--akin to that of the peson who bore the ring in Lord of the Rings.  Flood waters were rushing by, filling up and sweeping away my car.  My father had cut down the euonymous tree--only in my deam it stood at the end of our driveway and in its absence you could see that everyone had been cutting down everything else, too, so that now from the end of the driveway you could see a clear-cut path to the harbor.  Now our house sat at the top, rather than the bottom, of a hill.  I could see where the water had rushed away leaving a natural bridge of rocks midway to the middle of the sea.  People in hiking gear and ponchos were wasing around.  A white van, filled with people, floated its way from the harbor to the end of our driveway,
1983 20030116095807 To Grandmother's House We Go   At my grandmothers' house (except her house had changed completely--it  was an old Victorian-style house now, with an upstairs sitting room and  grand curving stairway as soon as you came into the house), my family had gathered.  Everyone was complaining about something: my mom didn't  want to be there; I was having ridiculous adolescent-style power  struggles with my mom;  my sister Sarah   and  my sister Kate  were being, well,  my sisters; my dad was saying how the trip upstate had become the  equivalent of a death march, whatever that meant.  My granny herself sat  small and shriveled in her turtleneck and cable-knit sweater.  She  didn't say much but she seemed to be waiting for us to go.  I had to get ready to leave.  In a couple of hours, I was going to fly  somewhere else--not home (wherever that might be) but to an interview or  some other function for which I had to be both punctual and well- dressed.     I went into the old-fashioned corner bathroom to get ready. There was a  gas-light on the wall and old warm-red flowered wallpaper. Somebody, my  grandmother I think, had already drawn the water for my bath. But  there, sitting on the far end of the tub, almost submerged in it, was my grandmother's cat, Leo.  "This will never do," I said, and tried to lift  him out, but he only submerged himself in the tub, his head surfacing occassionally to spit water at me.  I saw that beneath him, my  grandmother's other cat, Cleo, was doing some sort of water ballet.    Apparently Neither Time nor Fashion Were Issues  Later on, I had decided to go to an immense Salvation Army thrift store  to buy clothes for the aforementioned interview.  I put on an acid- washed knee-length ruffled denim skirt and a really hideous red crinkled  silk camp shirt, several sizes too big, with authentic leisure suit- style epaulets.  I looked leisurely at my watch and saw that my plane  would be leaving in fifteen minutes.   
1987 20030207092207 I might make it California's fault Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault   With a bunch of other observers, I was attending a U.N. meeting in a partitioned room (one of those conference rooms that can be subdivided using movable floor to ceiling panels).   Joschka Fischer was presiding over the meeting.  Only he didn't look like  Joschka Fischer .  He looked like  Wooly Willy .  He also had a pair of round clear red plastic frames like those popularized by   Where's Waldo .  Earlier, to indicate his contempt for some U.S. policy, Fischer had sent a duck to attend a speech given by George W. Bush.  In response, the U.S. had started playing pranks on other U.N. members, some of which involved bathroom booby traps.     I was sitting between a woman I knew from Texas, Natalie Miles, and some other guy. I was trying to get the guy to read Patrick Kavanagh's poem  "Epic" .    Meanwhile someone's hiding in the classroom Busy forging books on history   Earlier, I had been walking down the road--it was West End, but it was not West End. There were high mountains in the distance and lots of hills everywhere.  I had driven down to a meeting place at a gas station.  There was a police line just before I turned into the station where we had to declare any weapons we might have.  A small girl with long golden hair and a violin, probably only about seven, had sailed up into the sky and was floating away with her instrument. There would be no way to get her down.  I worried about how her mom might react--I knew that the girl would probably fall into the sea somewhere--but there she was, like a forlorn balloon, getting smaller and smaller.  "I don't even know if I really like this instument," I had heard her say when she was still close enough for her voice to carry to the ground.  A group of students was going to protest because the governing body of local schools had ruled that they could only study the version of history presented in their textbooks.    
2063 20030514034808 the dream of monday night, 5/12  My sister Sassy was so sad about her upcoming track meet--almost inconsolable as she thought about having to stand out on the track in ready position waiting for the starting gun to go off, maybe a little cold in the late spring drizzle and the short shorts and tank top of her track uniform.  As she explained how she felt I suddenly remembered how it had felt, how your legs turned to lead out there while you were waiting and you were suddenly certain that you wouldn't be able to run at all, much less twice around the track at a sprint, but that you were at the same time certain that you would force yourself to run, your feet like heavy bricks, your upper body strangely upright so that you felt almost as tall as the people watching from the bleachers on the side.   "It's alright, Sarah," I said, over and over.   "It'll be alright." Sarah had shown me the notes she'd left for our dad for Father's Day.  She'd constructed a whole elaborate hoax centered on two notes she'd signed "Keith Richards".  Inside a house that was simultaneously our current house and a grandma's or a strange person's, the chandelier in the bathroom suddenly fell. There was a little bit of warning--a creaking noise--then it pulled away from the wall and fell to the floor.  I'd thought the bathroom was downstairs in the house, in the same position that our downstairs bathroom is in our house, but then I was standing downstairs and the ceiling began to leak and fall, as well. I realized I was standing just underneath the bathroom with the fallen chandelier.  Upstairs in Sarah's closet (actually in the old armoire that used to be in Kate's room), I found western wear that I hadn't worn since high school, a golden seude coat and a white shirt with funny snaps and fringe.  Our friend Molly was falling asleep wherever, including on the large  sundial outside in a garden.  I had to write myself html tags to wake myself up.  Whenever I wanted to stop sleeping I had to enclose myself in brackets and the command "by".    
2082 20030404093408 Rick and I had walked to a diplapidated and half-deserted shopping mall at the crest of a hill.  A Dollar General gleamed in the background, unattached and at the bottom of the hill. The mall had contained a massive movie theater, but that was empty now, replaced by unneeded stores.  We walked inside but the inner doors were locked. People were milling about in an inner atrium: it was 10:00 am, and the mall would open at 10:30 am.  Suddenly we were up on a higher hill above the mall, and we were sitting in a room-sized glass-enclosed bus stop pavillion.  I heard a young man say, "There goes that damn possum."  I looked and saw a tiny possum, no bigger than my hand, rooting through a planter outside.  The man who'd pointe it out rushed out with  big stick of wood.  "Don't kill it, please!" I called out to him as he walked out of the paviliion.  He kept striding off.  "Please don't kill it!"  I ran after him, begging him.  He had the baby possum in one hand, almost strangling it, and the block of wood lifted up above it as though to smash it.  I grabbed a tin can, hoping to capture the possum inside of it.  But though I trapped the possum inside of it, the young man and I got in a scuffle and the possum scurried off.    Then I was inside a room.  A woman walked in; we were going to trap the possum, this time with a Hav-A-Heart trap.  She had a possum-sized trap wiht her, even though it was only a few months later and the posum was probably not yet even full size.  Suddenly I saw something stirring underneath the wall to wall carpeting.  A giant nose appeared from behind a large chest--the nose itself was the size of a Great Dane's snout.  I realized the possum had grown enormous, and was going to fight us as we tried to capture us.  The possum was the size of a small pig.  We tried to throw a comforter over it and gather it up.  It was leaping at us and we were trying to harness it with ribbons.  I finally got it to latch onto a ribbon; then I looped it around its head like a reverse halter.  The possum turned into my friend Molly.  
2082 20060226112008 Throughout all my dreams was the compulsion to say or spell "regard" backwards: "drager", except I kept getting this word mixed up with "danger" or with "drawer".  The observing crew of visiting Arrowmont judges passed through the room again to look at a book I had made.  I hadn't realized it was being juried but apparently it was.   sall man with black hair and a beard liked this book and had brought people back just to see it.  He asked me if a folded piece of paper in the front of the book was part of the project and I said no, though I didn't know the book was a project. When they had left I looked at it again and it seemed like nothing more than a journal, filled with scraps of writing and doodles; nothing unified.  Kate, too, had a project, a large stuffed cat with writing in it that people were tkaing close looks at.  When we went downtown to the film processing place I realized that I did not have my money, so I ran back to the car to get it, running as fast as I ever had in my life.  But when I returned the shop was closed, the lights were out.  I would not be able to drop off my film this day.  Walkign downt he hill, it was still light, and as I stepped over the ground covered in low-growing daisies and myrtle the silver-haired drag queen just looked at me.  Earlier another land, an alternate dimension where we were walking up stairs sideways.   Later, the side of Dragon Park closest to 21st was mapped on to the side of 21st closest to Mellow Mushroom, and there I saw a tabby cat, apparently laying dead, with a robin next to its head, alive.  But as I watched, the cat, which apparently had been just stunned, got up and started walking across the street. No cars were coming, so I stopped my car and called the cat over to hurry it up.  It got in the car without any coaxing and I looked at its tags.  1134 Overland read the tag but underneath was another piece of paper that materialized like a hologram to say "1134 Overland has moved to ____ Capers Ave."  So I figured I would just drive the cat over there to return it home. 
2089 20060901073015 in the fairfax house, i run out the side door at the top o the house, run down the street.  i am capable of gliding on air and i wonder, as i circle back past our house, why none o the ladies who see me are surprised that i can float five feet above the ground with no more motion than constantly pulling at the air with my hands.  waiting int he dark restaurant area, i am trying to draw a self-portrait of my face, looking in the dark mirror to see myself and represent myself more accurately than before.  there is a muslim woman who approaches and gazes longingly at a hotdog spinning around in the warmer on the countertop and i realize that she needs it for her hungry children.  i have the nickel to purchase the two split halves of the hotdog on the bun so i pick it up and give it to ryan bernholz who i think will give it to the lady and her kids and instead splits it with jenny romer.  i take twelve cents or seven cents and put it on the cash register.  now it is impossible to return to my self-portrait.  i go down the hall to the old bathroom, in past dreams gateway to something beyond and older than the school.  here it is just defaced with graitti over an ad campaign by a local group of historical reenactors.  inside i must maneuver around many boxes and try not to careen into many people, including keisha.  i realize i have missed the orchestra evaluation that mr. coffey, my last high school orchestra teacher, was taking us to.  i see a bumper sticker, black and white illustration o penguins and cute creatures in a furrowed field, several animals with instruments walking up the open field next to them, the estival's name "take steps back to forward" or something.  i meet up with a young guy who thanks me for some small musical favor i had done him the other day.  he is going to play tongiht with his friend and invites me to stop in.  "no reading, though", he says, and i knowingly say, "so you just play then?" and he responds, "no, we challenge each other by askign if w can play certain songs.  if we can than we move on because there   
2100 20030203080408 Double Dare   I was in the darkened gym of my high school trying to get out of participating in an Olympic-style competition featuring tumbling and rope- and wall-climbing.  My high school gym teacher, Ms. Strassenberg, was exhorting us to participate.  RIMboy and Jen were taking camping lessons with an older white-bearded guy in a Hawaiian shirt with binoculars around his neck.  The man had found out about a program Jen and Sean had started--a non-profit that taught outdoor survival and orienteering skills to inner city kids--and the older man wanted to become a patron of the program.  Later on I was getting in a car in front of my parents' house.  The whole family was going to a street festival that was being held in downtown Nashville (or some other location a little more urban than Long Island).  My dad was driving the car, which was very crowded--my mom, my sisters, and a man from Untitled were sitting in the back of a compact four-door car, while another woman and I were sharing the front passenger-side seat.  I was yelling at my mom because she wouldn't tell me if it would freeze overnight.  I wanted to know if I should bring my housplants in.  I yelled that I wouldn't go to the festival and asked for my mom's housekeys.  When I went into the house to check on my plants, the family left.  The car turned into a station wagon as it rounded the bend of the driveway.  I actually hadn't expected my family to leave without me, so I was kind of shocked.  I stayed home pouting.  Somehow my sister Kate invited me to a festival called a  Priyad .  It was a combination of outdoor music festival and series of physical challenges.  After we returned, we were searching for my sister Sarah to see if she wanted to attend the next one in a few weeks.  As soon as you returned from the Priyad, you had to decide if you wanted to attend the next one, and submit your application form immediately.  I woke up after this part of the dream.  When I went back to sleep I dreamed that Rick was preparing to attend the Priyad, too, but his friends were making fun of him.  
2100 20060517071008 hybrid of plant and ghost  Walking at the edge of Erika's property where a landscaped area had been many years before.  Now the ground was hard and compacted but you could still see the outlines of the beds and the shades of the flowers and plants that had been placed there.  I was excited seeing it because it was like discovering a secret garden or finding trace of human habitation and mark-making in a place that you thought had returned to wilderness.  The area was shaded.  There were patches of bare dirt and there was a pathway, as well, that we were following.  There was a slight drop and a tiny stream that flowed, underground in some places. Earlier in the dream I had talked about the freshwater stream behind Debby Iberger's house and perhaps about a ghost or evil spirit that inhabited the corner where Jean Neil and Debby's houses were.  Back with Erika I passed a deep pool where it seemed the water stopped for a bit -- but the water was clear, not dank as I had expected, and so I realized there was water flowing through there too.  It was probably at least five feet deep, and you could see to the bottom -- so it was difficult to actually judge how deep it was.  When we turned the corner we were half in, half out some old industrial hall.  Rick was beside me.  He pointed out where the tomatillos were growing but what he pointed to was what looked like a tiny mine shaft.  "To see the one person at a time has to ride down inthe elevator," he said, "with one person left back up top to pull them out."  There was a tiny dumbwaiter, about the size of a medicine cabinet.  I tried getting in it but could not get my body inside. I was trying and trying and finally moved the upper shelf of the medicine cabinet up slightly so I could just barely fit my head in.  I wasn't really in the cabinet but I was going to make the descent anyway.  Rick started lowering me down.  There was no light and I was a little scared of fallingout since I was not secured inside.  The waltz of black dress, brown paper something, something else, over and over again in 3/4 time. 
2103 20030315123420 We were returning from a special mission, Mike Wells, Laura Sobik, the tall woman Stephanie from freshman year of college, and myself.  We were packing up our stuff in Stephanie's room, which was softly lit by overcast daylight flowing through a gauze curtain.  I was trying to gather all my stuff, but as soon as I had gotten one set of items picked up, more pieces seemed to materialize between the two beds side-by-side in the room.  I was checking up on things downstairs at one moment; my sister Kate and my mom were down there in a glass walled sun room, eating ham sandwiches on tiny biscuits.  They were trying to get me to continue my mission and perhaps do something even more dangerous, like travel back in time.  My mom did not like how our group had been run. Among other things, my mom did not like that my hair had been cut into a semi-mullet: I had long coppery hair from my ears down, but the top of my scalp looked like a Barbie's or baby doll's when you cut their hair to the plastic scalp.  Small tufts of hair were sprouting out in a grid across the top of my head.  "You need to put a bandanna on that," my mom said.    At some point Rick, too, was involved in a special mission--only his was to learn the vocal parts for a challenging role in an upcoming musical.    I saw a photo of an amazing spot--the caption said that it was "the last natural spot in the Adirondacks, the Alleghenies." There were enormous mountains rising up from a bed of geysers--some shooting thirty or forty feet in the air.  Even though the mountains were massive, they did not overpower the geysers, which poured into a broad and rocky river.  To the left of the geysers, a mirage of sorts shimmered beind a screen of trees; a waterfall fell from broad and impossible heights, sheltered by trees it fell through without knocking down.  As I looked at the photo in the magazine, drops of water from the waterfall obscured the lens, as though a videocamera were recording this footage live.  I looked at the caption again and knew that I would have to see this place in real life myself.  
2103 20030804090007 as round as an apple, as deep as a cup   My high school orchestra teacher Karen Dow had sent me a packet of small trinkets.  Among them was a pin made out of brass and copper safety pins with lots of other metal hanging off of it.  Her little son Scott (now no longer little) had made me a couple of these pins, too.  We were driving through an unreal city, up a winding road to the queue for the ferry.  We wanted to pass through just to get to the other side of the ferry loading area.  It felt like we were driving through a tollbooth.  On the other side a swarthy young man around my age was walking around the halls of a giant factory/school.  He was opening the industrial size freezers and evaluating the contents.  "This is very unhealthy," he said, lifting up a bag of chicharrones.  He was the security guard and he was not supposed to be making such judgements.  I walked outside with him to where the fifth graders were playing recess.  I stopped to talk to Jessie Guerrero and then realized, as I walked further, that my security guard friend and about four or five of my students had been put in time-out  Michael Garza was there, with his book of religious symbology.  His brother died in real life in combat in the Gulf this spring and in my dream this little book, with hand-rubbed images of whales and dolphins and owls and crosses and Virgin Marys was Michael's memorial to his brother.  The girls and boys were segregated in time-out--the girls were in the front foyer, the boys in the back room.  I stayed with the girls, since the security guard was standing with the boys.  Everyone had to stay on their own 2 x 2 square of masking tape on the floor.  Veronica was one of the girls I was watching over.  She was looking through a combination of two books I had loved when I was little:   The Illustrated Child , by Peter Bennett, and   Mother Goose  .  I remembered each of the pictures she was looking at so well I think I could have drawn them from memory.   As soft as silk, as white as milk,  As bitter as gall, a strong wall,  And a green coat covers me all.  
2117 20060228105808 - i tried developing the photos i ahd taken but ghosts and our young   selves (kate's and other cousins' and my own) kept appearing in them.   also, whatever i had shot was different than the spots i had actually   walked with my subject, who may have been joe hardwick but was also   someone else.  there was a whole set of shots supposed to   take place in a field but instead the shots ranged from a vineyard   to the harbor by my parents' house: joe's back with wings made out of the   vines illuminated by sun; the tips of our faces in water made green by   seaweed and blue by sky; walking across water?  - when i stopped by the photo developing place, it was my aunt chris   behind the counter.  i tried explaining that i had, for instance,   dropped off a package of black and white film to be developed, and had   color film returned, but realized that what i was explaining didn't   make much sense.  - someone decided the best place to smoke their marijuana cigarette was   in the back of a police car, during the time while the six officers who   had been stuck in the car, clown-style, were out walking the beat.   the officers were very friendly to me, smiling and waving.  the people   int he back of the car eventually realized where they were, and,   somewhat panicked, stumbled over each other in order to get out.  - i was taking a bath in the middle of the room, but the clothes that   were hanging around the bathtub to dry were falling out.  shards of   pastel colored metal were falling into the tub and were swirling   inside it.    - i forgot the best part - looking at the photos they were actually   suddenly in motion - the background was blurry and the front was very   clear.  the effect was like when you dirve along the road and   alternately focus at the visual streaming of the trees or shrubs or   guardrails going by, or look at isolated elements as they pass, so   they seem almost stationery and above all distinct and separate.  what   was so cool about the illusion of these photos is that you had both   types of apparent motion or perception going on at once. 
2126 20030626222808 You could not tell whether it was morning or evening twilight.  There was fog on the lake, and on the dock stood a girl in a dress from the turn of last century.  She was tall and solidly built, but shapely; her long hair was pulled back in a bow.  Standing next to her was a boy of indeterminate description in short pants and a bowl haircut that went down past his eyes.  The water was lapping against the pylons of the dock and in the fog it seemed they might be sitting on a floating island in the middle of the lake.  The air lightened as though it might be sunrise but otherwise the world and the air were still.  A rowboat parted the fog and grazed against the dock; the girl pointed to it and they got in.  There was a black dog lying on the boy's chest.  The girl sat by the boy's feet, her legs up against his.  She dipped her head back so that her black hair trailed in the water like a flag.  She said something that at the time I could not make out.  Far later I realized she'd said, "Tide's going out."  They had been swept out to sea and it was night; they'd spent all day on the boat together dreaming and hadn't even realized their ship had been swept out to sea.  Now it was night and they had to row the boat back through high waves and wind.  The boy took the oars and the girl got out and swam behind the boat, pushing it forward.  At some point they both got out and swam, guiding the boat through the night-black water.  The passed a research station with a shark cage; they swam right up on it, accidentally, and only the rusty bars of the cage where the shark swam, jaws bloody and ancient, kept them from being gobbled up.  They kept on swimming, past another research boat with a "katy shark", a guide shark, beneath it.  They got to the dock.  It was time to work on their papers--vast college tomes of cross-outs and diagrams and cross-references.  They were due tomorrow, and they'd spent their day off together underneath the sun and stars, instead of on the land, working.  In other news, Jason Laster of NLUG and Stevie Wonder were singing a pop duet together on "Star Search". 
2128 20030304091407 In a large cafeteria, I was sitting near kids who in high school had teetered on the edge of dweebiness.  Suddenly Brian Consolo was at the table, talking with me and his foster mom about his battle with sniffing glue.  I heard Andrea Hickey shouting very loudly at my student Jeli, so I walked over to the other portion of the cafeteria where I'd heard her shout.   "Who just yelled at Jeli?" I asked, as though I didn't know.  Then I took Jeli outside to the hallway to reprimand her.  I was trying to be very strict with Jeli but it was hard to keep a straight face as I squatted to be on eye level with all thirty-two inches of her.  We had to make a journey, some students and I.  I made the mistake of letting a student drive; she wouldn't stop when I told her to, and kept on driving over lawns, field, and driveways.  I got the car back somehow and set off towards Atlanta. It was nighttime and I had to turn the car around since I'd just driven past our entrance ramp.  I turned around in a gravel parking lot where Hispanic men were roasting and eating goat.  On the road to Atlanta, we realized we'd have to abandon our car when we got to a large suspension brige.  You could either walk along the edge of the bridge, where the cables came down and attached to the bridge a second time, or you could walk in the center of the bridge using the monkey bar style grips running down the center of the church. Far below the bridge there was a combination of water and air; you didn't want to fall.  i dropped my Kinko's Teach for America canvas bag and it fell slowly through the water.  Ifelt kind of bad--in my dream, it was the second TFA bag I'd lost in that many days.    On the other side I realized that I was, in fact, attending a TFA conference in a poshy hotel.  I went off to look for Rick, a dinner.  I ran into him in a bathroom, where I realized I had been using someone else's disgusting (as in dirty) toothbrush.  Somewhere in my dream I had been trying to construct a folio/collector's edition book on the wars in the Balkan states, but it was too large a topic on which I knew too little. 
2134 20030510133608 a hidden egg the color/of hyacinths   I was playing in a small orchestra and for some reason I was to play the viola solo.  The walls of the practice room were old peeling wood; they looked like a tree trunk where the bark has been peeled away to reveal the cambium.  A middle-aged man with a sandy beard, a pockmarked face and dark brown-tinted glasses took the solo from me and started playing. His viola, too, was peeling like the walls.  He played so beautifully--he was a professional musician--that I was trying to remember his exact nuances so that I could play the solo the same way.  But I was worried, because I had never practiced it before.  Later, in a public building, Rick was about to present his annual report.  He'd prepared a special draft for me--in an old-style eight point font, with doodles and commentary writeen everywhere in red pen, so that it was nearly impossible to read.  I was going to have to read from it, only I was afraid I would not be able to see it.  Franne Lee had disappeared to NY, but not before she spotted me in the bathroom and let me know what I would need to do to run the Plowhaus in her absence.  In the public school bathroom where we had met, I was struggling to get all my belongings off the floor and onto my back.  Someone was helping me.   Arie  came in at some point, looking befuddled.  The woman who was helping me carry all my stuff said to him, "It's all right--take a look around.  You've probably wondered what a girl's bathroom looks like."  I thought this was strange and innapropriate, as there were other people not connected to us who were in the bathroom as well.  On the wall was a strange dispenser for soap that I had first noticed while i talked with Franne Lee.   Later, as the other woman helped me, she asked about a double-hinged mirror on the wall.  It folded together with a central hinge--more like a folding gate.  It also could move up and down and sideways on the wall, almost of its own volition.  Later I dreamed of the band  Le Tigre ; I dreamed I was their music.  Just as I woke, I found a big pale turquoise egg, the size of me.  
2134 20060210093208 The window above my computer was open slightly and snow was getting into it.  I rose up slightly to look at it: I was suddenly raised up very high, almost until I was dizzy.  Across the street I could see, as though I was at a point very high up, two pickups speeding down a sandy street that looped around a hill and came out like the base of a T to join our street.  The trucks were going very fast, almost out of control, but the way in which they were handled gave the assurance that they did this frequently.  As I looked out the window, snow piled higher and higher and was blowing through the window,piling on the things around me.  The wind and snow were blowing me backwards and I was gripping onto the frame of the window to hang on.  Then the wind lifted me up, carried me in the air, and dropped me on the floor some twelve feet away.  Rick was looking for something in my closet.    "DId you see waht just happened?", I asked, surprised.  I was walking through the back rooms of a laundry house, full of rooms, to get quickly to the other side of town.  Ont he other side I encountered a number of miniature donkeys, only about hte size of chihuahuas.  These turned into miniature golden retirevers a little further up; people were goign to use them as guide dogs for a special walking tour of the city.  I stopped to pet one shaggy miniature English sheepdog.  Allen Saturn had died and Nancy Saturn, very long and lean and aquiline, dressed in a long white tunic over leggings, was leading a group of travellers who were picking out their animals.  Julie Sola was there too and we were takling.  Nancy Saturn had amazingly long white hair.  It had grown about a foot and a half in one year.  Walking toward the street, I saw an area that looked like a maritime dream of a long time ago.  Strange people were walking up the road, with an assortment of bizarre mustaches, hair colors and fashion choices. They were walking upthe center of the road and for some reason I felt compelled to walk by them without making contact becuase they seemed vaguely dangerous.  They were goign to a house of ill-repute. 
2135 20060301082807 Sarah and I decided to go running.  We were going up a big hill that was behind my parents' property but doesn't really exist in real life.  We realized that our sister Kate was coming down the hill but we were trying to get our full run in, so we were trying to run past her and take a side path.  But Kate really wanted to be with us so we wound up sticking to the main path.  But then the sky was growing dark and threatening.  Suddenly we were in a tunnel that at the point where we were was still illuminated by outside light, but further on there was only darkness.  We started moving forward into darkness but I heard something -- a far off train whistle.    "No," I said, "we can't go in there."  Other people were walking into the mouth of the dark tunnel, seemingly oblivious.  The section of the tunnel where we were walking was very narrow and precipitous -- a drop on either side of about two hundred feet down to water on one side and rocky scree on the other.  Right next to where we were standing there was a flimsy wooden rail that led onto a narrow strip of exposed roofing, and I told Kate and Sarah we had to climb on it until the train passed so that we wouldn't be right in its path or right on the side of it.  I was straddling the fence as the train came rushing along.  The couple in front of us flattened themselves against the wall of the tunnel, which enclosed itself on both sides where they were standing. But the train, which was yellow and green (green nose, yellow body with maybe some diagonal stripes of green), came only to just before where we were on the fence, paused, then chugged backwards after uncouling some cars further back in the darkness.  Later, after adventures in the giant vegetable peeler / razor at the Cracker Barrel, and the vending machine with all the large, somewhat burned flapjacks at the bottom, we were in a roo with a pool of lobster sunken int eh ground.  We had to take then out and put them in a net to bring back to the ocean.  "We must let them go now," someone said.  I was Sponge Bob or Stimpy's character and I felt great love for these lobsters.  
2152 20030528072808 The secret police had come for us.  They'd broken into the brownstone where I lived (I was a man), and one of them was inexplicably carrying, alongside his rifle, a glass dispenser for lemon shock tarts that he'd broken off its stand at some point outside.  "Well," I said as he opened the door and motioned me inside with the butt of his rifle, "at least you brought snacks."  We were in Narnia. It was still endless winter.  I recognized the landscape as the side yard of my parent's house, transformed by mounds of snow.  In the woods on the hill, though, dark green pools of ice were melting and for the first time ever bright and luxorious grass was beginning to grow beneath the oaks.  Somewhere water was gurgling and flowing; I could hear it beneath the snow, coursing across Blameys' property.  I was pouring water into the mounds of snow and it was eating through it, eager to meet up with the other water.   The tunnels it made widened.  I'd poured it where the old Willys used to sit on the edge of our property and Blameys', but there were tunnels now beneath where the coal bin used to be.  Mr. and Mrs. Beaver had ducked in down the tunnel and were busy packing stuff to leave, I assumed.  There was a wizard behind me, a kindly but very wise sort.  We ducked down in the tunnel too, which seemed impossibly large for something just formed of water.  It was like a small cave tunnel made of ice.  It twisted and turned and at some point, branched off into a small passageway not large enough for us.  The wizard was claustrophobic.  We turned around.  Soon, I realized, the witch and her wolf would travel down these same tunnels in their search for us.  But we would be gone.  Somehow on the other side of these tunnels--that is, where the tunnels led-- Arie  and some others were waiting in a classroom.  I had missed most of the lesson--we were supposed to be keeping tabs on a Supreme Court debate.  I'd typed out notes ahead of time.  There were three important issues the court was deliberating.  On one of the decisions, the members had come out as expected, but there were two other outcomes that were unexpected. 
2153 20030225093608 Two Hands on the Wheel   I was driving with Rick, Les, and Lana over country highways.  My drviing was erratic--I would whip around corners and drift into the other lane.  Lana, who was sitting in the front seat next to me, was getting sick and cranky.  I realized that I did not have as much control over the vehicle as I thought I should because I was "ghost-driving".  Rather than grasping the real steering wheel, which was inconveniently located on the floor between the accelerator and the brake pedal, I was moving my hands back and forth in front of my chest as though they were gripping a steering wheel.  It worked to steer the car in the broad direction of where I wanted it to go, but there was little fine control of the car's movement this way.  When I grasped the real steering wheel on the floor in my hands things got a bit better.  We cqme to a new portion of the country highway; it was a government checkpoint, but it had been set up like a giant truck-stop style service area.  I stopped in the middle of the four-lane road to let an old man and woman and a young woman with a funny, bald-headed-but-able-to-walk baby cross at the pedestrian crosswalk.  Inside the government checkpoint/themepark reststop, I parked the car and went off on my own to find a restroom.  Inside the restroom, which I really just wanted to walk through, I glimpsed an ad featuring a lot of famous people (although the only one who comes to mind right now is Maddona) "singing" a product theme song through careful editing of past performances/appearances in locations unaffiliated with the product. The exit to the restroom was different than the entrance; the restroom exit would lead to the exit for the entire theme-park rest stop, where, no matter where you parked, your car would be brought so that you could pick it up and get on your way again at the end of your stay at the rest stop.  The highway between the entrance and exit, I reasoned, must have to be in use for some other governmental purposes than civilian transportation, I reasoned, because that stretch was closed off--the detour around it was through this rest stop.  
2166 20030405103807 href="http://www.cmmarathon.com/">marathon  now."  I thought maybe I would run, too, so I checked out the course--an underground track resembling a subterrenean parking garage.  Very few bystanders watched from the gloomy sidelines.  I decided to run just because there were so few people participating or watching.    We had to run around the course 25 times, so off I went.  I soon discovered that it wasn't very smart to have run the marathon in a denim skirt and shoe boots.  Suddenly I was in the much better-lit office of Ms. Servellon, my former boss.  There was an important meeting going on in her office; I wasn't really invited, so I was trying to squeeze past the people at the meeting so that I could leave the room.  There was a glass display case with a mirrored background and free-standing half-octagon shelves.  It was filled with all sorts of china, porcelain, and crystal knicknacks.  The cabinet started acting all flimsy and rubbery, like something in a bad mixed live action/animated movie. I kept trying to make it stand up, but it would collapse onto me.    Finally Ms. Servellon came over, asking, "What in the world are you doing?"  Since to me it was completely obvious (what with the china cabinet pinning me to the conference table and all), I just pointed to the cabinet and asked her to take the knickncks off of it so that we could try to repair it.  Her office, I noticed, was filled with china cabinets and knicknacks.    "Well, I realy just have htis in here so I can check my own reflection, don't I?" she said, looking into the mirror that formed the backboard of the cleared off cabinet.  I tried to affix a long string, part of a shade that could be pulled down over the mirror, to a protrusion on the wall above the cabinet, but then thought better of it.   Ms. Servellon moved intoher other office, across the hall, this one decorated with publicity photos of movie and country stars.   I found myself in a streetside storefront.  Pictures of Hank Willaims' daughter, a beautiful blonde woman with a birthmark covering much of the right side of her face, hung on almost every wall.  Someone in the shop said, 
2167 20060118143408 In an old house where we had gathered for a picnic I suddenly grew aware of the presence of a couple.  Suddenly the scene was transposed to the back room of my parents' home, and the child, whom they called muneca and who was indeed doll-like, like Thumbelina except knee-high, was standing on the floor.  It was only six months old, yet it could talk and walk, and it came up to us (I was with somebody else?) with wide eyes, pleased by our presence.  It began dancing in a funny baby way but there was something very old and ritualistic about its movements.  We were entranced.  I realized with horror that the charming baby had three arms.  Two came out of its torso, like normal, and one emerged from about navel level on its right side.  It sort of dangled there, and I could not tell whether it was functional or not, but it seemed otherwise normal.  In fact, the whole baby body was proportioned like an adult, with a head not overly large for its frame, and long lean limbs, and with a beautiful face that was like an elf's.  I took the child in my arms -- it had shrunk to the size of an infant -- and walked arond the house with it.  I realized that I could not put it down.  I had to wash my hands,though, so I went into the bathroom.  But when I emerged I realized that I had lost it somehow.  I looked around me to see if it had crawled or hidden under piles of my mom's paintings or my father's tools, but I could find it nowhere.  I went out of the room, hoping that it would return to me magically.  I stepped into a mall that looked like the main concourse of Nashville International Airport, I saw first Rick's cousin, Alison, with a black bobbed hairstyle, mincingly walking around with her rockabilly boyfriend.  Everyone, it seemed, had the same bizarre hairstyle, specific to their gender: the boys, a matte-dyed punk-rockabilly Elvis-meets-Interpol helmet, complete with large, unkempt chops; the girl, a samurai top-knot, underdyed bleached blond and shockingly black on top.  Lesley Patterson-Marx emerged around the corner, dressed in long flowing pale blue robes, a young baby in her arms, with the same bizaree hairstyle.   
2187 20031113000207 Rick and I were going to be late for a wedding we had been invited to, the marriage of Rick's childhood friend and his beautiful bride, whose whole family had come over from the Phillipines to see her wed.  We drove by weathered wooden houses, tucked up against the side of the country highway, surrounded by plains and--in the distance--vast mountains.  This was Montana in November.  The sun shown as though through a piece of waxed paper; then suddenly it burned through the low clouds and emerged, dazzling, throwing the ripened fruits on the trees in each front lawn.  There were peaches growing at some houses, and oranges at others.  The old people were out picking the fruits.  They had each set up folding card tables in their front yards (which actually were side yards since the side of the houses, rather than the front, faced the road).  On the table were glass pitchers filled with many different types of juices--pink grapefruit, orange, peach, pear--all homemade.  This was a form of church, to make these juices.  Rick pulled into a parking lot before our hotel stop, and I asked what he was looking for.  "A furniture shop," he said.  The store before us materialized into a hardware store before my eyes.    "But we have to be there at 6:30 p.m. for dispersal," I told Rick.  It was 6:17 and I still had to get ready.  I didn't actually understand what was going to be dispersed.  It turned out we didn't have to be there until later.  I waited in the car, reading a program from a dance performance.  The dancers were in the car just in front of me, watching me as I read.  I was trying to convince them to come through Nashville more often.  Then, at the hotel, I glimpsed the bride and her mother embracing outside the public restroom.  The mom was embracing her daughter as though she would never see her again.  I started up the marble stairway, but I stopped at the bottom when I glimpsed my friend Alina.  She had made a photo collage for me of all the place we had lived.    Somewhere, there was a field of pumpkins, so saturated with orange it looked like a brilliant-colored sea.#%#date=20031115085608  #%#title=The Semi-Political Mother Goose
2205 20060710104407 My mom and dad were talking about the woman who was trying to sell her property to constuct a synagogue.  Her husband had just died and when my parents or someone else went to visit her (probably someone else since it was my dad telling the story to my mom), the woman asked angrily, "Are you the one coming by to see about the synagogue?"  She was more angry that people were putting the business deals on hold due to her husband's death.  My parents thought her behavior in poor taste.  I went with my dad out behind the house to see where they might put in a synagouge.  My dad suggested that the county could step in and build a synagogue anywhere along the wooded side of the road.  "They could put one int here -- or better yet, where that bowl-shaped depression is." He pointed behind Edna and Steve's, on the other side of the road, where a kettle hole was.  I noticed as if for the first time all of the intricate houses on either side of the road.  They had elaborate steps and multiple levels.  Perhaps they were small models of houses -- it seemed they did not get larger as I got closer.  I think aobut how lucky I am to have grown up among such unusual houses.  "But dad," I ask, "the county would have to seize the land that some of these stairs are on." My dad nods his head in agreement and says the county would take it by imminent domain.  I see a rock garden and a bench that would be seized if the synagogue was put in.  There are blueberries growing, and I scramble up some rocks and stand on a ledge to get them.  My dad stops me.  "Are there any more of those large blueberries?"  i have two in my hand.  I realize my dad is concerned to see them replicate next year, and wants to be sure that soem of their seed remains.  I point out another big blueberry on another bush.  My dad smushes one of my blueberries and leaves it out to be reincorporated int he wild.  "You know, Ali," he says, I don't think that I've ever seen youe at a full breakfast."  I try to explain that I don't always feel hungry when I wake up.  It's time for me to get off the ledge.  I'm struck by a sudden, sharp feeling of vertigo.  I can barely walk, I am so dizzy and afraid of heights. 
2221 20030611085407 my attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines   It was time for everyone to leave the school.  Even the clerks from the main office were walking out the door.  I was supposed to call one child's parent to get the dad to come pick the kid up.  I kept mis-dialing the number, though, and ending up calling Frazier Rehabilitation Center.  In a bar the size and shape of an elementary school classroom, I was standing at a high table counting out the contents of my pockets.  I'd spread the change I found in there al over the table--I had easily fifteen dollars in change, plus a number of small bills.  A loud jukebox was playing "Bob Wills is Still the King".  A couple and their family had come in and were talking loudly at a low table with too small elementary-style chairs.  A man was sitting, plucking at a guitar or restringing it, I can't tell which.  He was playing the first bars of "Your Cheatin' Heart" over and over.  It was a punishment, of sorts.  I was walking up to my friend Sean's house, humming  "The Guidelines" .  "That was my mothafuckin theme song," I said, but I sounded pretty stupid, so I laughed at myself.  I passed by the Marciano's house, which had grown into a full-scale complex.   Over sixty members of the individual family lived there, in motel-style housing units.  The children ate outside on gigantic tables made of electrical cable spools, eight feet off the ground.  I was climbing a mountain.  I saw illustrated pages from a brochure before me--people huddled under yellow blankets, packed in tight along the trails of the mountain.  "Note: blankets are not distributed during winter, due to research that shows that people who are freezing to death growmore forgetful if they're given something to warm them up a little bit."  I wanted to classify a bunch of rocks I had found.  Suddenly I realized, though, that for homework I was supposed to have written a computer program to do the sorting for me.  I was sad that I wasn't supposed to do the classification myself.  Arie had showed up, and was running up and down the steep trails of the mountain.  Brandon, Rick and I were trying to convince him to skip a party he was going to in order to hang out with us. 
2228 20030316153207 in the latest paris styles   My family had gathered in a gymnasium; people were sitting on the bleachers.  I wanted to visit with them all and couldn't.  My nanny was wearing black lacy pants and a frilly black mantilla.  She was sitting on a bleacher adjusting her pointy shoes.    "All the girls in the office say this is the latest style," she said, pointing to her frlly cuffed pants.  She lifted them up past her calf to check her ankle.  Her calf was covered in liver spots; I was nervous because she had a big bruise on her shin.    "Oh," she said.  "Would you look at that bruise."  My friend Alina was baking potatotes and talking about grad school research projects in my parent's kitchen.  We were both wearing tee-shirts only; they struck our legs at about mid-thigh.  My mom came in and made some comment that made me depressed; it was kind of ambiguous, but I heard her say, "You've gotten big."  I was so sad that I was short-tempered with Alina, who didn't know how to roast potatoes in our oven.  Later on, students from the Valley and students from Houston gathered in big cafeteria.  A bunch of students were sitting on a makeshift stage; there was a press conference of sorts going on, though who was running it--school administrators or an outside group--I could not tell.  The atmosphere was carnival-like--parents and children walked around with food, and there was loud talking and laughter.  At first I was standing in shadows, watching as several parents got up  in front of the students on stage to make statements to the press.  One parent was exhorting different sets of siblings on stage (all his kids, but with different women) to stand up and give a holler to show their pride.  I walked to the back of the cafeteria, where my students Damian and Marco were standing behind a snack/salad bar, holding an enormous package of  Lik-m-Aid Fun Dip .  They were supposed to be operating the snack bar, but they were clowning around.  I tried to look at them sternly but I kept laughing, because they were being funny.  The package of Fun Dip was half the size of Marco (never a large child to begin with), and Damian was hiding Marco behind it, or wrapping it around him like a shawl.   
2233 20060925083209 remember both her name and the dark glasses she would wear as she drove her son to school in her old station wagon.  We went up the steep driveway behind the woods behind my parents' house, to her home where Carl Weinfeld used to live.  At the top of te drivewaythe trees were all cleared andit was a hotel in the style of a western frontier town.  We passed a restaurant where we knew we were to meet a successful young man who would help us get oriented to the city.  We saw him in there with some business contacts and did not want to intrude.  We drove off looking for his apartment.  Past the hotelwhich was shaped like an "l", darkshingle siding, it had beent here since the turn of the century, the view opened out to a city street; I drove down it looking for the apartment 3217.  We couldn't find it over and over though I looked and turned around several times. We found ourselves back near the restaurant and I had a flash of insight -- we needed tofind building 3201 and the other numbered apartments would be within that numbered building.  BUt we were by the restaurant and the young man came out and requested, insisted that we go inside.  It may have been dangerous for us to continue to drive around looking for him.  There was an ongoing salad buffet except you placed an order for it and the waiter or waitress brought it to you.  It was the end of the afternoon so my sister, mom and I got a salad that was mostly a big grey button=down women's shirt, four grey handkerchiefs, light to dark, some purple onion, sliced carrots and dressing.  My mom and sister were talking about plastic bowls that could beused to make paste.  I sat with the gentleman whose house we were lookign for. We were staying with him through the end fo the week.mmKate was leaving before us and on Friday I would go back to Long Island to spend some time with my family and friends.  "Tell me more," I told the man who sat at a bar height breakfast counter on the opposite side of me.  He hit his fist against the table and I did the same with mine.  "Do we have a movement to open this meeting?" I asked.  "No," he said jokingly but vehemently.  We looked over to see a young Asian coupletalking anxiously to one another. 
2235 20030605091608 invasion of the a(u)nts   Ants everywhere in the upstairs bathroom.  Downstairs, Alina's aunt with the long Roumanian name had asked for a vaccuum cleaner.  Luckily Alina herself had brought a vaccuum with her, as ours had a broken belt.  Hers was standing upright in the downstairs kitchen closet, which was strangely bereft of clutter: all the laundry was off the floor, and tools and supplies were neatly hung on the wall.  The vaccuum was an old Soviet model.  "Lyubyu" I read in Russian on one side.  "Zyemla," I read on the other.  The other woman, another relative of Alina's, who was sweeping in our kitchen was teling me that I needed to put a bag on the vaccuum.  She did it for me--I hadn't realized that the bags were tucked for storage on the underside of the vaccuum.  Upstairs again, Kate and my mom were pulling styrofoam bricks from the walls to peer in on Bill Kottenstette's rooms.  He rented them from the landlord.  Kate and I were debating whether he was pretty or not.  I argued yes but she said that his nose was funny looking, and that it canceled out his hice eyes and mouth.  The space we had created by removing the funny styrofoam wall (it was a fine styrofoam, more of a foam, really) was just above our bed, which for some reason was on an elevated platform, so we could climb up and get a bird's eye view of Bill's warm lit room.  His lampshades all seemed to be made of wax paper, or else he lit his room by candlelight.  It all had a warm, reddish-gold glow.  Now was the time of the ants.  I was going to take a bath, so I walked intot he bathroom.  But ants, fire ants, maybe, were swarming and marching from a crevice where the back edge of the tub met the wall.  More ants were joining them from the north--high above the faucet, ants were marching from a large slit and meeting up with the other ant army.  I was trying to flush them down the drain, but I felt really bad killing them.  Ants were climbing up my legs, biting me.  I ran outside to explain what was happening to my mother.  Then I went back in and tried flushing down some more ants.    Somewhere there was a secret room in this house, but we ever got to it: I only remembered it from a dream I had a long time ago. 
2236 20030128093808 Grey Day   My cousins, aunt and uncle were visiting us in Nashville.  The sky was overcast and threatening.  I was playing a game with my cousin Harrison in the back alley. The game board was a set of shallow-rising steps that stetched wider than the alley.  We were moving life-size figures up and down the steps according to some strategy: the pieces progressed in rank as they moved up the steps, and at the top were made queens, which gave them all sorts of powers.    Rick and I were digging for treasure with a large group on the edge of an unknown town. No one was finding much.  Rick's dad was there, looking on, possibly in some sort of supervisory role.  There were snacks available: thin slices of unripe cantaloupe, dried-out carrots cut like crinkle-cut french fries, a slurry of split peas and some other legume.  I think Rick's dad had prepared them, so I was reluctant to criticize them.  I was looking through a South Texas phone book.  Under the heading for a small town beginning with L or T, seven letters long (I can't remember the name, now), I found an entry for someone named Bellos--Zedzely Bellos.  "Must be a Russian Lithuanian," I thought to myself.  I thumbed through some of the other towns' sections.  In the section for Mission, there was a an entry for Hdrd Bellos.  "Must be Hungarian," I thought.  My aunt was calling to say that she couldn't visit, though she had visited already.  "I need to stay home and tend to a dying plant," she said. "It may well be dead already.  But Uncle Scott,Wes and Harrison will come."  It was late afternoon, and the sun was trying to break through the clouds--you could see a faint glimmer of pale gold behind the curtain of the sky.    In our house I was dancing around in the living room listening to the news.  It was greyer than ever outside, and the living room was dim.  Some movie was unexpectedly sweeping all the others at the box office, and now everyone expected it to win lots of awards.  Someone in the house was suggesting that we "transform our security system" (I couldn't tell, in my dream, if they were talking about our house or our nation) by "retraining our video defense system" on footage of ?Syrian? planes and crash landings.  
2240 20030226093208 Our friend  Brandon  had made a tiny  fold-up motorcycle.  At first when he showed it to us, it was the size  of a postage stamp.  Later I was looking at it more closely--he'd folded  it up and stuck it underneath the counter of this sort of studio we were  standing around in.  It folded up into a rectangular wire cage, about  the size of a long narrow shoebox.  Rick, Brandon, and I were sitting around in a living room.  Rick's  brother Les came in and Rick started making Les guess things about me  based on the movements of my hands.  "Talk to the clue hand," Rick said.  I had gone upstairs.  In another room, a young homeless guy with many  pockets on his acid-washed jeans was talking to me about the piece that  he would submit for an art show.  His pockets were filled with pens and  pencils--many looked like my pens and pencils, but I reasoned he could  have found writing implements like that anywhere.  He went to go drop  them off soemwhere.  Another woman was sitting in the room with me.  She  was laying on the bed and kept trying to give me compliments, but she  kept getting flustered and saying, "That's not what I meant...I mean..."  I was substitute teaching in a class filled with students I graduated  with in high school.  The class period was interminable and some  students kept trying to cut out and escape.  Other students-- particularly Daniel Boudon and Carl Paparella--were playing around in a  closet that for some reason was full of my dress-up clothes.  In a mean  teacher voice, I told them they could borrow my clothes if they wanted  but that it would have to wait until after class.  Some students were filling out a ridiculous worksheet that had a map of  the United States and Canada on it. The students had to fill in some  information about climate zones and conditions.  But the map had a scale  running in a straight line along the US-Canadian border--it was supposed  to indicate average temperature and range of temperature in each region.   However, the midpoint of the continent was marked 0 degrees--to the  west, the temperature increased, and to the east the average temperature  decreased, until it indicated that the East Coast's average temperature  was -60 below..   
2245 20030618115407 dream of 6/17  People's horoscopes that I was reading in a large book were strangely accurate.  We were watching a documentary on the Eagles--their life, retold backwards through grainy, black-and-white photographs.  They had left the States and touring to settle on an archipelago in the South Seas.  In the last known photo of the band--the first one shown in this documentary--they were all dressed in striped convict suits.  Two of the members  had gotten married to each other and as a symbol of their undying love their hands had been handcuffed together behind both of their backs.  Bryce had made a score of tiny spraypainted faces, including that of a bearded Amish man.  All the strawberries I was trying to eat were moldy.  dream of 6/18  I was late for the graduation ceremonies for my high school.  I had been playing around outside with my friend Sean; we'd walked around among deserted houses, still half-standing, and we had discovered a resaca running from fields down to the sea.  There was a large pear tree by the resaca, and I was eating the pears that had fallen to the ground, but Sean claimed that they tasted like leaves.  He was walking on the slushy ice on top of the resaca; he kept falling in.  Back at the auditorium, where thousands had gathered, graduation ceremonies had already begun.  I didn't want to hang out; I didn't even want to walk to the stage to get my diploma.  "I'm tired of high shcool," I said.  "Why do I have to go back?"  Some people were leaving to go get sodas--among them, Ryan Bernholz and a bunch of people with last names beginning with B.  I walked with them for a little bit--it was through the halls of my elementary school--but then I realized that my name was about to be called.    At Mom and Dad's I was looking for clothes to wear for Easter.  I was thumbing through drawers and cabinets.  I found tons of old books and toys from our childhood, but actual clothes were hard to find.  I tried wearing several tablecloths as wraparound skirts, but with no luck--they shortened, turned sheer, or turned into elaborate beaded belts when I tried to do so.  I finally settled on a short flowered skirt from ninth grade.  My sisters, too, had forgotten all their clothes. 
2246 20061006083008 In class the teacher kept hounding me, my third grade self, to get a copy of the reader that I needed.  i finally picked it up.  earlier, grim ms. servellon patrolling the halls of a house.  Along the wooden path we walked, a group of us, travelling through the woods to the next village.  i scooted back behind the wooden fence to walk on the other side.  a hawk swooped down towards us.   -look at the enormous hawk, i said, but then i looked again and realized that it was not enormous, rather a juvenile.  it dove at our heads. brandon was there, and the hawk was diving at him, opening its beak. brandon reached out his knuckles at first to ward off the sharp tearing beak of the hawk, which clamped down on his hand. but then suddenly when the hawk opened its mouth again, brandon reached in its mouth and pulled out its tongue.  rick took the hawk and was stroking its feathers and looking in its mouth.   whoever had a hawk's tongue and kept it in their pocket could have good luck and the granting of one wish.  brandon wished out loud for a fishing pole.  Mat-teus-pela-heu, "Ocean-becomes-salt", was coming.  He had taken on a native name but in his thinking he was thoroughly colonialist.   -He thinks very much of himself, one lady said.  He was trying to reform the educational system.  In the library I saw the enormous gold bound and jewel encrusted book that I had taken out some time ago, with a brown swallow on the cover, some book of fairy tales.  But I was looking for a book of Adrienne Rich's essays, _The Arts of the Possible_.  I saw the librarian.  Bryce McCloud had returned books we, members of the nebulous silkscreen coop, had taken out through him.  But the books had been so late and so numerous Bryce owed over one hundred dollars in fines for our books alone (nevermind his).   -You'll have to split the fees among you and pay him back, the librarian said.  My mom looked to see where I, stepping aside form the PE class required to run many laps around the building and around the hilly neighborhood, was writing downt he dreams above in a small notebook.  I felt embarrassed for her to read them.  She kept hoping htat my stomach pudge was the sign of pregnancy but in reality it was just fat. 
2250 20030429094407 I was running a marathon that I had started the day before.  Rick was running with me, too, for a while.  The chip on my shoe let me know I had about six more miles to go before I finished; the miles went by relatively quickly even though this was the obstacle section of the course.  In one room I entered on the trail, a small creek ran over large rocks.  We were supposed to scramble over the rocks to eventually make it up to an area where tall rough-hewn wooden picnic tables, about three feet by three feet square, teetered precariously as we stood on top of them to climb over.  I was talking to some women sitting at the tables.  "It reminds me of a game we used to get out from the basement of my grandparent's house to play," I told the woman.  "It was called--(I called in Risk, in my dream, but in real life it was called "Don't Rock the Boat")---and the object was to stack your plastic people on a raft floating in water, as high as you could, without having the raft capsize."  I continued to hop from table to table.  Then I ran down a set of concrete fire escape stairs--stairs from other angles kept coming in and joining the ones I was running on.  I was still ont he marathon trail.  Rick was wiht me again--we were outside the coliseum.  Only a little bit to run.  Inside a large cafeteria, I almost ran through the finish line before somebody stopped and redirected me.  I ran past my family--my mom and Aunt Barbara were trying to get me to look at a piece of corn chip.   I kept running--I had figured out I could finish the marathon on just under five hours.  "We're waiting on you only," said the woman by the entrance to the finish line.  a bunch of kids were milling about.  "Okay," said the woman as I joined them.  "Go!"  We ran another ten meters through a wall of baloons.  Then she handed out stickers with our times.  Oddly, mine said "3:08"--I didn't know how that was possible, annd the conversation with the ref did not help.  A small child beside me, dressed like a soul singer, was asking about the availibility of different foods--this least section of marathon was in a grocery store.  "Do you know where Djibouti is?" he asked, but he was actually asking about a breakfast cereal like kasha.  
2253 20060830081808 Beth Gilmore had books she had made on the landing of a stirway.  One book was just a simple canvas binding, one sheet inside that said "book book book spine book".  There was a scrap o paper from a Fugitive brainstorming session where she'd listed various dried and preserved foods: sunmaid prune, dark organic chocolate.  The challenge had been to come up with a list of dried foods "foods with solid interiors") that described your personality.  Dirty bath.  ORganic material had dried out on the bottom and I was trying to scrape it off.  Sarah said how nice the bathtub itself was, which was true, even though loating pieces o hair and stem and dirt drifted through and atop the water.  Sarah was heating water in case we needed to supplement the lukewarm water coming out o the tap.  People from grade school were standing at my old bus stop, on Jensen's property -- thn all set o down the street.  This was after the woman had set o down my parents' driveway, mad at her partner for some reason, heading toward the airport.  We drove through West Egg and East Egg, my sister Sarah barely controlling the wheel, water on either side o us, pockets o green land surrounded by water.  When we reached a t-intersection, 25th Street inexplicably at right angles to 41st, we knew we had to turn right.  A woman with ankle-length dyed-maroon hair, middlea-ged had beenhonking her horn or motorist assistance at the last light, one block down, to no avail.  We were looking for a store or meeting place at 2501.  Outside the window o a glass fronted but old apartment, I could see one clooud detach from the rest and swirl like a dust devil high in the sky, moving fast beore us.  "Look," I said to Rick, who remained airly unconcerned.  Sarah and Kate and Keisha were behind me int he darker part o the apartment.  I looked out over downtown, many blocks away, where clouds were swirling and billowing with cyclonic motion.  "Looks like we might have to get friendly with the basement," I said.  "Yeah, but not or another forty minutes," Rick said.  That's how long he thought the storm would take to move to where we were.  I didn't think my sisters should go out, but Keisha was trying to convince them to go with her to go buy bread.  
2258 20060727102807 yesterday (7/26): wearing the wedding dress at work at finer things.  it had a long lace train that, when i looked back, i realized i had ripped perfectly around a single rose.  kim also had on a white dress but it was not a wedding dress and of course i felt rather silly having to carry the train behind me, watch where i was going, etc.  outside in the grey overcast day franne lee was standing on the porch in front of the locked and shuttered gallery doors.  she was in a pink fuzzy bathrobe with some sort of cream-colored lining and she was haranguing a crowd of people also assembled ont eh porch.  she wanted to be let in.  today (7/27): the woman who called on the phone was from a foreign land. as she spoke i saw before me on our kitchen table a flat map that assumed depth as i looked within it.  the equator, which was called something else, ran through europe, bisecting the netherlands (now to the west of france), germany, france, and much of eastern europe.  it was because of the water that encircled them that england and ireland, wales and scotland were so cold, i reasoned.  the woman was from a francophone country.  i was trying to explain  why she might like attending watkins.  however the connection was bad; i didn't really have the info i needed; the wind was picking up outside making it hard tohear; sarah was on her cell phone and kept making hand gestures that she needed to talk with me.  there were long patches where i just ignored the woman on the phone (i couldn't hear her talking).  the trees were moving in every direction and the wind was making a groaning sound. "it's a tornado," i said.  "let's go downstairs."  sarah and i went to the basement.  we went into the side room where we will put the root cellar.  i sat int he dark closet spot, sitting under a three foot cobweb that stretched diagonally across like a safety belt. i realized that the door to the outside at the top of the three steps had only a screen and that the outside wall was just a short foundation, about a foot and a half high, and then a screen covered with black plastic.  if something fell in we would not be protected.  i pointed it out to sarah and she said, "i never realized that."  we moved into the other section.   
2263 20030210100607 Wake up!  It's Spring!    Two men in long robes were standing in the center of a burning ring  about seven feet high and six feet across.  As the ring burned, I could  see that the flames illuminated writing that stretched across the ring;  or actually, that each tongue of flame was a page with burning words  written across it.  One of the men, about thirty years old, was the new pope.  But the other  man was a historical figure.  It was his words, I think that were on  fire, and they blazed with their own power.    We were in a land where people were ill-prepared for snow.  A group of  people had gathered in a lodge on a high hill.  There was a floor-to- ceiling glass window from which we could see the snow clouds gathering  on a set of mountains, far away.  We watched as the clouds gathered and  then as sunlight pierced through them, illuminating the whole sky and  the mountain peaks.  But the clouds continued to mass; they were black  and blue like storm clouds.  Then suddenly they burst open, like seed  pods full of seeds.  The mountainside was drenched in snow; the clouds  were moving furiously across the mountains.  The sun was gloriously  emerging from and then disappearing back into the clouds above the  lodge.   At some later point, Rick and I were in a secret room, very small,  between the walls of my parents' house.  It was the best heated part of  the house because the vents that let hot air up from the coal stove  downstairs were positioned directly below our feet and above our heads.   I was in sis Kate's room at my parents' house.  I was standing by the  window.  Outside, it was dazzlingly sunny, but snow and rain kept  falling intermittently as well.   I was trying to set the alarm clock,  which consisted of a rubber tube and a small hand pump attached to a purple tulip-size crocus outside.  The crocus was already in bloom:  setting the alarm consisted of pumping up or letting out air from the  crocus to make it bloom more or less.  I kept trying to set it for a  shorter length of time by letting air out of it to make it bloom less.   The petals would close for a little bit, but the heat of the sun would  make the blossoms gradually relax, and the crocus would soon be in full  bloom again.

2280 20030815211607 dream of 8/15   all the spaces that reason has not been able to fill with words or conventions   In my parents' living room, sitting next to someone, both of us working without looking at each other.  My mom sitting to my left overseeing us. The person next to me grazed my foot with his own and I pulled back, ashamed.  The wet dream of the graphic designer: the beautiful 12" x 10" oversized literary digest, featuring short stories in translation from writers since the turn of last century.  The story I read at first a fifteen page spread, short several paragraph long tales based on pieces by  Piero della Francesca .  Some pieces the stories were based upon had never been seen before, and the experience of turning the pages of the magazine was that of walking upon the rediscovered ruins of an ancient and beautiful time.    The stories were modern retellings of the stories presented by the paintings.  There was one about the Medici family, for instance, that had been retranslated and adapted to portray New York City under mob control.   The illustrations combined all sorts of mediums without seeming coy or overworked.  When you turned the pages quickly the stories animated themselves, projecting themselves onto the walls in front of you.  I turned the pages to read another story, vaguely reminiscent of some of Tolstoy's religious-overtone tales.  I turned to the beginning of the section, where each story had a two page spread about its author.   Tristan Tzara , the name reminded me of, but it wasn't exactly.  He looked like Tolstoy and Walt Whitman bred together--he had lived at the turn of the century but he wasn't a surrealist--he had the strange quality of a weinermaner.  He was a mystic, and, some thought, a saint.  Later, Rick too was a dog watching over a bunch of livestock sleeping on the floor of a barn lit by the sad warm light of a yellow lantern.  All the other animals were sleeping, heads nestled in among each other, warm in the darkness.  Only Rick looked up awake with sorrowful eyes.  "A yellow field surrounds me," he said, bathed in a pool of light.  I dreamt of the highways that sweep and criss-cross Texas, I dreamt of the places there I had never been, far west to El Paso and, I thought, the edge of the world. 
2286 20030604072207 It was time to get some gas for my bicycle.  I drove it down a small hill, down to the out-of-the-way unmanned gas kiosk, a single pump tucked into the side of a hill.  Mrs. Canas appeared, and we both wound up parking our bikes along the crest of the hill.  Suddenly I realized the pump would not reach that far.  "I'll need to move this," I said, trying to drive my bike the ten feet down to the pump.  "Try this," Mrs. Canas said, handing me a vacuum attachment.  I was not sure at all how to use it.  I put it down at the base of the pump, in a crevice that was disturbingly like flesh.  Then I was trying to vacuum a woodshop that had suddenly sprung up around me.  Shreds of newspaper, like bedding for small rodents, lay scattered on the floor all around me.  I was on the phone with my mom.  I had been about to take a bath.  She was walking to my Nanny's house from her car--I was joking with her, saying that she was walking to Nanny's house all the way from Mount Sinai.  My mom grew suddenly sad.  I had made fun of her, or been abrupt in my need to go.  She was crying.  I asked what was wrong: it was that she didn't want to do anything any more.  I was trying to help her figure out what it was she actually wanted to be doing.    My mom kept switching the conversation back to our family.  "Well, Michael and Regina had a boy, you know," she said.  "And Michael has been trying to get in touch with you so that you can come in for your sister's high school graduation.  I wasn't going to invite you since we'll just see you in July."  Then someone was eating Tony the Tiger cereal, but through some bizarre chain of references and transmorgification, it was going to be transformed into the Cereal of the Workers' Party.  As the name changed, so did the packaging and marketing of the cereal.  The chain of names went something like: Tony the Tiger Moghul Bran The Moorish Invasion Dar-es-Salaam Flakes Oats al-Islamiyah Casa Nostra Cereal The Industry Robber Baron Bran The Means of Production Cereal of the Workers' Party  Just as I woke, I was dreaming of a race car driver, the spokesperson for Middle America Cereals, who had lost his toe in a race and was selling two items: replacement toes, and his patented anti-infection/toe growback formula.   
2295 20060226122607 Throughout all my dreams was the compulsion to say or spell "regard" backwards: "drager", except I kept getting this word mixed up with "danger" or with "drawer".  The observing crew of visiting Arrowmont judges passed through the room again to look at a book I had made.  I hadn't realized it was being juried but apparently it was.   sall man with black hair and a beard liked this book and had brought people back just to see it.  He asked me if a folded piece of paper in the front of the book was part of the project and I said no, though I didn't know the book was a project. When they had left I looked at it again and it seemed like nothing more than a journal, filled with scraps of writing and doodles; nothing unified.  Kate, too, had a project, a large stuffed cat with writing in it that people were tkaing close looks at.  When we went downtown to the film processing place I realized that I did not have my money, so I ran back to the car to get it, running as fast as I ever had in my life.  But when I returned the shop was closed, the lights were out.  I would not be able to drop off my film this day.  Walkign downt he hill, it was still light, and as I stepped over the ground covered in low-growing daisies and myrtle the silver-haired drag queen just looked at me.  Earlier another land, an alternate dimension where we were walking up stairs sideways.   Later, the side of Dragon Park closest to 21st was mapped on to the side of 21st closest to Mellow Mushroom, and there I saw a tabby cat, apparently laying dead, with a robin next to its head, alive.  But as I watched, the cat, which apparently had been just stunned, got up and started walking across the street. No cars were coming, so I stopped my car and called the cat over to hurry it up.  It got in the car without any coaxing and I looked at its tags.  1134 Overland read the tag but underneath was another piece of paper that materialized like a hologram to say "1134 Overland has moved to ____ Capers Ave."  So I figured I would just drive the cat over there to return it home.  Dancing with Kate to "Take Me Out" / "Dark of the Matinee".  Making a theater out of a camera obscura.  Jennifer from orchestra in the upstairs of our house, and someone else I can't remember, also unexpected.   
2296 20030604075407 It was time to get some gas for my bicycle.  I drove it down a small hill, down to the out-of-the-way unmanned gas kiosk, a single pump tucked into the side of a hill.  Mrs. Canas appeared, and we both wound up parking our bikes along the crest of the hill.  Suddenly I realized the pump would not reach that far.  "I'll need to move this," I said, trying to drive my bike the ten feet down to the pump.  "Try this," Mrs. Canas said, handing me a vacuum attachment.  I was not sure at all how to use it.  I put it down at the base of the pump, in a crevice that was disturbingly like flesh.  Then I was trying to vacuum a woodshop that had suddenly sprung up around me.  Shreds of newspaper, like bedding for small rodents, lay scattered on the floor all around me.  I was on the phone with my mom.  I had been about to take a bath.  She was walking to my Nanny's house from her car--I was joking with her, saying that she was walking to Nanny's house all the way from Mount Sinai.  My mom grew suddenly sad.

2301 20031107093007 Dream of Montana--the home of our old Mount Sinai neighbors, Edna and Steve, their ranch home ringed by mountains and by a shallow pond, golden in afternoon sun, avalanche-felled tree trunks littering the bottom.  I realized then that I had been out to Montana in my youth--we had spent a holiday here--but I had been bookish and sickly.  Each feature of the landscape suddenly recalled that trip I had taken long ago, and the mountains and the sky and the terrain suddenly seemed familiar again, as though I had glimpsed an aerial photo of my childhood home after a long time away.  We were planning a surprise party for sis K, and my father had decorated all the outdoor sites around Steve and Edna's with banners describing how "you, too, could be a hero".  The posters listed names and gave the photos of local heroes, describing the virtues that they possessed that enabled them to act the way they did.  I heard at the last minute from my mom that Kate was planning a sudden trip to Fort Worth, Texas.  I tried to convince Kate on the phone that, from Montana, Fort Worth was too far away to drive to and return from in two days.  Earlier, students of mine were excited as I walked into the classroom bearing armloads of fall leaves.  Some I had gathered several years ago; these now were pressed flat, the surface polished as though the lost light of autumn had been concentrated in the dry veins.  Some students were gathering handfulls and throwing them to the floor.  It was time to line up and be dismissed.  After some shuffling, we formed a single-file line and wandered off the art and technology hallway of my old middle-school--a parade of familiar faced teachers from elementary and middle school walking their students down the hallway, too.  At an outdoor picnic table, as I ate a soup that resembled potato and seaweed, two women, my age or a little younger, approached.  They asked us about our ethnic heritage and our names.  I complied and asked them theirs.  One woman had an Arabic name--the other--Shanna--I knew or had seen at some orchestral event.    Later, talking about the agricultural exports of the US, including livestock, as we surrounded a beautiful ceramic donkey.  We discussed how livestock could be transported--could a really large SUV suffice?
2309 20061112114408 ancient grecian empire continued until today. a leader's plan was to marry into the carious barbarian tribes to prevent them from gaining control of various cities.  in a border town on the other side of the mexican border.  a white man was berating his children in front of a public restroom.  I went inside to follow the young girl, a toddler, who he was yelling at.  there's another young girl of preternatural intellignece, maybe four or five, inside consoling her sister, explaining that her dad is bitten by ghosts, which makes him act that way.  i understand by this that she realizes that her dad is haunted by memories and driven to drink.  the dad is coming into the bathroom (along with a bunch of other parents monitoring their children) so i have to pretend to go to the bathroom so that i can spy on him.  but the stall to the door is no more than a rigid shower curtain that a child in a stroller keeps pushing open.  i drove too fast along the new interstate into and through mcallen. even though i was only driving fortymiles per hour, this was too fast for the road conditions and the speed of the other cars.  i kept having to ride my brakes and everntually they started overheating and i was forced to dive without them.  then there was a section of highway with red lights for us as cars merged onto the highway from our right.  i kept running the red lights, narrowly missing hitting other cars.    later, after going to sleep again, driving down a street again en el valle, we are going too fast, someone else is driving, an older man, some relative of rick's or mine?  i don't want to be driving so fast,it's making me dizzy and flinging me from side to side.  we almost crash into several cars as we pass betweenthem, creating a new lane.  we are supposed to turn on meredith street.  we are back at my parents' place somehow.  my parents are ont he phone trying to convince me to take linens and a set of gymnast plates (but i see that they are actually cheerleaders on the edges of the plates and bowls in the set.  after getting in a fight with my mom and sister about this, then reaching some resolution, i am trying to write in my journal about the similarity between the "real-life" event of driving int he car and my dream about it.  we are ont he road again.   
2311 20060503111008 Bryce's shop, but not.  the beautiful, crudely drawn murals by the hip-hop mogul who would turnt he rest of the shop into a secret underground dance haven.  but what was this in back, where i was sneaking around unknown?  this was part of a building that i had seen in other dreams and that i knew went on undendingly, room after subterrenean room.  franne lee was coming to the party.  i had to get away!  but i could not.  she was clinging to my leg and talking on and on.  much later i am back in this same shop area.  only now i am an adolescent boy with two other boys.  we are on bikes and we are investigating the mysterious disappearance of our friend.  we hop behind the door of a garage and peer out.  there is the large group, the bicycle gang, peddling along, and there is our friend in front, seemingly dead with his eyes bugged out in front of him, lids and mouth wide open.  but i know that he is just stunned and will wake up soon, but then they will kill him.  we have no time to lose.  but we are now locked in the garage.  somehow we get out.  we chase the gang.  it is night thorough wide streets with shanties on either side.  really we are to be powerless on our small bikes -- one of us just on a foot-powered scooter.  i see our friend nowhere and i am worried that they have drowned him in the creek and buried him in a shallow grave along the bank.  but i plead with some of the gang members anyway.  one is kevin rangel, my old student, and his older brother.  i try to tell the older brother how he can help kevin to have a better life.  i offer another girl, a young version of katie neil, my hair clip.  at first she refuses it, saying she does not want to touch anything that's been on my head but i persist in offering it, tell her she can put it in boiling water.    earlier the bus-boat with the party-going nashville musicians and the pool in the way way back.  "here is how we adulterate eternity," said the large men to me when i kept hitting my alarm clock's snooze button, wondering why it would not let me sleep for longer.  "in any group of ten minutes, we take away some portion and replace it with Nothing, so that each successive group is shorter than the last.  one never gets ten perfect minutes of sleep, for that itself would constitute eternity." 
2317 20060901075611 in the fairfax house, i run out the side door at the top o the house, run down the street.  i am capable of gliding on air and i wonder, as i circle back past our house, why none o the ladies who see me are surprised that i can float five feet above the ground with no more motion than constantly pulling at the air with my hands.  waiting int he dark restaurant area, i am trying to draw a self-portrait of my face, looking in the dark mirror to see myself and represent myself more accurately than before.  there is a muslim woman who approaches and gazes longingly at a hotdog spinning around in the warmer on the countertop and i realize that she needs it for her hungry children.  i have the nickel to purchase the two split halves of the hotdog on the bun so i pick it up and give it to ryan bernholz who i think will give it to the lady and her kids and instead splits it with jenny romer.  i take twelve cents or seven cents and put it on the cash register.  now it is impossible to return to my self-portrait.  i go down the hall to the old bathroom, in past dreams gateway to something beyond and older than the school.  here it is just defaced with graitti over an ad campaign by a local group of historical reenactors.  inside i must maneuver around many boxes and try not to careen into many people, including keisha.  i realize i have missed the orchestra evaluation that mr. coffey, my last high school orchestra teacher, was taking us to.  i see a bumper sticker, black and white illustration o penguins and cute creatures in a furrowed field, several animals with instruments walking up the open field next to them, the estival's name "take steps back to forward" or something.  i meet up with a young guy who thanks me for some small musical favor i had done him the other day.  he is going to play tongiht with his friend and invites me to stop in.  "no reading, though", he says, and i knowingly say, "so you just play then?" and he responds, "no, we challenge each other by askign if w can play certain songs.  if we can than we move on because there is nothing technically interesting in that."  i am sitting on a lanket that must be moved.  the young guy and three other men begin to move it with me on it but i am asking themt o stop so that i can get off and help to move it.  
2330 20050324014008 Dreams I had while I was sick  -Outside a multi-storied public library with ornate sandstone colored columns -- looked like the Supreme Court, I guess.  The sky was the bright blue seen just before sunset.  We were outside ont he steps waiting for something to happen and it did.  A girl in a black and white striped top shot out the top window, a guide line spitting rapidly in front of her.  A distinctively Bad Man followed behind her, cat burglar style, walking on the line like a tightrope walker.  He had on a black bandit eye mask.  This was a movie trailer for a Swedish film about Anka the child spy, superstar chef (she had escaped from the kitchen, where she had been cooking souffle) and all around amazing girl, a combination of Pippi Longstocking and Pippa from Pippa Passes.  We all wanted to see the movie desperately, because we loved this character Anka so much.    I went in the library, now actually a bookstore, to see if I could find the picture book the movie had been based on.  I searched the cafe, where they were supposed to have a tie-in display.  Instead I found a book in Russian featuring 3-d textured paintings by an artist who made incredibly personal psychological self-portraits.  "He is a German Expressionist, though a Russian", the book flap said in Russian.  Then I found a book on Ralph Steadman.  There was page after page articulating why Ralph Steadman was a bad man, in the sense of "crotchety old fellow set in his ways", all done in rather tedious question-and-answer-restate -the-question-within-your-answer format.  I was weary of this, looking for pictures.  -I was in a railway terminal.  Thousands of people were around me and each sentence they spoke took physical form and landed on the ground until I began to suffocate.  Each of the minutes, too, took shape and piled on top of me.  Birds were flying high above in the sunlight of the dome of the train station.  I would be doomed to know each thing that transpired in that terminal in actual time.  I woke up every twenty minutes because of the bars of hot iron being applied to my back underneath the mattress.  Only half an hour after I woke up did I finally realize that it was the snooze alarm, and not hot bars of metal, that had made me wake up every twenty minutes for about two hours.  Sorry Rick.    
2337 20030220081008 Terminalia   Rick and I lived in a strange house that was in the same geographic position as our current house, but laid out totally differently.  Floor-to-ceiling glass panels covered the entire front of the house.  Night had fallen and all the shades were open; outside was inky black. It looked viscous.  There was a Mexican woman who was my sister.  She was tiny--4'9"--and on her way to a blind date.  The guy who came and picked her up seemed mean, like he might beat her.  She wore a lime green dress with red scarf wrapped around her waist three times, around her hips twice.  When they left--he making some crude comment about her not needing that many drinks because she was so little--I ran out to the car to offer her my shoes.  They were red  espadrilles  with red ribbon that laced up along the calf.  But she didn't need them.  Outside my parents' house, a dog and a cat, best friends, were resting. I was playing with the cat--a long-haired tiger striped/white-bellied cat.  Suddenly it got angry with me; its whole body stiffened and it got ready to strike me.  We had built a large trench in the side yard and filled it with water.  (At some points it was a trench and at some points it was a small three-foot above-ground pool.)  We were training cats to come and scoop out their own food from a big pile, throw it in the water, and eat it.  Suddenly we were training people as well as cats.  My nanny getting was having trouble getting in and out of the pool--it was three feet above ground and there was no step.  I looked around for a cinderblock to use as a step but I couldn't find any.  My nanny wasn't complaining but I knew her knee was bothering her.  We kept asking for my mom's support, since I had to physically lift my nanny in and out of the pool.  Later, I was reading a contemporary poet--Telling, Calling, some gerund of a name--who had transposed Ovid's poetry, maybe his Elegies, into a modern-day setting.  I was in a classroom again.  One of my students, Steven, was acting out of control.  I kept telling him to move to th time-out table and write down what was making him so angry.  Strangely, the teacher's aide kept throwing balls of paper around the room.  Steven turned into a toddler and ran across the room full speed into a table, raising a huge welt across his forehead.  
2348 20060224085408 a helicopter with two layers of two propellors flying outside our bedroom window.  some time after that, there is a knock on the back door that leadsinto our upstairs bedroom.  there's a whole family on the fire escape.  "the door's not open here," we say -- we're a little concerned to see people at our side door that no one even knows about, wanting to be let in. "we're just looking for a throughway through the house the man says," and we gesture towards the door again to show that it is locked, but the mom just touches the door and it swings open and her kids file in follow by he and her husband.  i recognize the woman as "bernadette" (who i don't necessarily know in real life).  i stop the kids as they are coming through the bedroom door and introduce myself.  "TimAy," says one.  "Bernadette," says another, clearly joking.  "Hello, Bernadette Jr.," i say, teasingly.  i am shaking their hands and everyone is more at ease.  the dad reminds me of a year ago, when he was called back by his seven uncles and had to leave me "in my scarlett o'hara dress" instead of hanging out with me as he had wanted to.  i realize how secretly awesome bernadette is.  her kids are playing now in a room full of toys and thy are so fun to watch. timay, the youngest, has become very young, two or three.  bernadette has given me a book, the inscription of which reads, "ali, don't let me forget to give you back your pancake [which was some sort of educational pillow / story prop i'd let her borrow to tell stories with her kids]. if my kids wind up taking this book back please tell me and i will sen dit back!  i can't wait for your tee-shirts! -b"  the book itself is super cool.  the illustrations kind of look like the ones fromt eh saggy baggy elephant, except the pages are longer and there are sheets of carbon paper so that you can trace and draw the images on the right side of the pages, which are looser, almost contour-line drawings of characters in the book.  on various pages bernadette has written questions about aspects of the designing and production processes for tee-shirts, and on one page she has just made a comment about the image of a baby elephant with his trunk stuck in a funnel: "it is like a pakistani trumpet" (or summat along those lines).  i am so honored to have a friend like bernadette i realize. 
2352 20030729074408 lose this skin   My mom and I had driven through darkness on twisty roads in some wooded and secluded residential neighborhood.  My mom pulled over for a second to let another car pass by us.  Suddenly it was overcast day and I realized we were parked in front of my cousin Kathy's house in Huntsville.  Her children and all of my southern cousins were sitting on the retaining wall outside.  I was still in the car and I felt uncomfortable I didn't have anything to say to them.    My Nanny came up, looking about fifty-five.  She had gotten long blond hair extensions--she had a blond half-ponytail running midway down her back, and a strange tiara made out of braided hair and solid gold that was woven right into and up from her scalp.  Sassy had gone to jail; she was home at my parents' house for just for a few minutes before she had to return to her cell.  She'd have to stay there for at least another night.  I was trying to eat the scraps of a blackberry pie my mother had left out on the table in the front hallway, but I could only find a spoon of dubious cleanliness in my suitcase.  A scrawny pigeon, the last passenger pigeon or a relic of the first age of birds, was beating its head against the glass panel of the front door.  Its eye was turned to us beseechingly, begging us to stop it or to let it in.  My paternal grandma was painstakingly filing each cancelled check her husband, my grandpa, had ever written.  She had an accordion-style group of file folders and each check, placed in chronological order, got its own folder.  My dad was bemused by this sudden desire to catalog what was long ago spent and recorded elsewhere.  I was mad at my sister Kate because I was showering and she kept trying to come in.  But it was my eighth grade sister who was trying to come in, who was just being her funny thirteen year old self while I over-reacted.  The water was getting cold.  Kate was sticking her head in the shower and lathering up with, variously, "Garden Rake", "Jimmy Carter Backyard Peanut", and "Fried Chicken" shampoos.  I found a sheaf of papers, no more than 3" x 2", painted and filled with my own impossible-to-read tiny writing.  Then I heard, faintly, music--a rock opera by the Clash.  I realized, as I started singing along, deciphering the lyrics on the page, that I was holding the libretto. 
2355 20060710113410 My mom and dad were talking about the woman who was trying to sell her property to constuct a synagogue.  Her husband had just died and when my parents or someone else went to visit her (probably someone else since it was my dad telling the story to my mom), the woman asked angrily, "Are you the one coming by to see about the synagogue?"  She was more angry that people were putting the business deals on hold due to her husband's death.  My parents thought her behavior in poor taste.  I went with my dad out behind the house to see where they might put in a synagouge.  My dad suggested that the county could step in and build a synagogue anywhere along the wooded side of the road.  "They could put one int here -- or better yet, where that bowl-shaped depression is." He pointed behind Edna and Steve's, on the other side of the road, where a kettle hole was.  I noticed as if for the first time all of the intricate houses on either side of the road.  They had elaborate steps and multiple levels.  Perhaps they were small models of houses -- it seemed they did not get larger as I got closer.  I think aobut how lucky I am to have grown up among such unusual houses.  "But dad," I ask, "the county would have to seize the land that some of these stairs are on." My dad nods his head in agreement and says the county would take it by imminent domain.  I see a rock garden and a bench that would be seized if the synagogue was put in.  There are blueberries growing, and I scramble up some rocks and stand on a ledge to get them.  My dad stops me.  "Are there any more of those large blueberries?"  i have two in my hand.  I realize my dad is concerned to see them replicate next year, and wants to be sure that soem of their seed remains.  I point out another big blueberry on another bush.  My dad smushes one of my blueberries and leaves it out to be reincorporated int he wild.  "You know, Ali," he says, I don't think that I've ever seen youe at a full breakfast."  I try to explain that I don't always feel hungry when I wake up.  It's time for me to get off the ledge.  I'm struck by a sudden, sharp feeling of vertigo.  I can barely walk, I am so dizzy and afraid of heights.   *sarah sleeping in her bed with the bag of broken glass from my studio *i try to remember some dream by giving it a title *margaret talking with me 
2377 20060216080008 At an old five-and-dime lunch counter, everyone suddenly turns against the waitress who has burned her hand preparing this one woman's grilled cheese.  They think she did it on purpose so that she could get her work to pay for treatment for an injury she already had.  Sarah stepping out from our closet saying something about Mark Cawkwell's opinion of the political situation in Yemen.  I am looking through a big magazine of contemporary art.  A series of photos, some black and white, some color, all of empty houses and edifices,wihtout a human soul to be seen, but each photo with a secret life.  Looking at the photos I feel like they are visual manifestations of dreams.  When you look at the photos it is as though you are inside of them.  There is one shot of an abandoned storefront, stone lions above its entryway and windows like eyes.  It looks like a Baroque stone version of the witch's house of candy in _Hansel and Gretel_. I take the magazine over to Rick to show him a photo from this one series on Stony Brook University in the snow.  The shot they've chosen is in color, but very muted, a back view of the university from a marshy area on the edge of campus.  Seen from this direction the university takes on the appearance of a decaying industrial city.  There is an interview with one woman who flies in planes to take her photos, talking about how she loves to look down at the land from high above.  There is a whole transcript of her shouting out loud when a plane ride takes her over the desert at night.  "If I cannot shout now," she says, "when can I shout?  I have to shout so that I can continue to shout."  Rick too is looking at the magazine now and we both agree it is very high-quality.  When we flip the page there is a series of pages of paired photos of Bill Cosby and his new child bride, Lisa ____, a model. The article is an in-depth interview with both of them, but separately.   Lisa is a beautiful child-woman and on some levels very mature, on some levels uncertain of what to do with her life.  After a photo of her jumping naked in the air: "On some level my relationship with Bill was too easy so I would find myself getting angry because it wasn't difficult.  It took time for us to realize that ..."  There is a photo with Bill COsby in the foreground, Lisa in the background doing the yoga pose the headstand. 
2386 20060713175208 my nanny in the house, offering me ice cream.  i am staying there waiting for someone ?  rick has gone to bed so it is someone else i am staying awake for. this is a deep dream when i am very asleep.  we have all arrived at the school building almost on the edge of nowhere in west tennessee somewhere  i see the music my old teacher ms. dow had commissioned for her students out somewhere in idaho.  i look through the many volumes of sheet music of another, uch more rigorous player.  i am looking at his sheet music for claire de lune.  i want to try to play it.  i leavve the building with andee the cellist from orchestra.  we walk out the many old covered wooden walkways.  we are going to find her car. we pass the newer cafeteria shaped like my old high school cafeteria. emma f. is visible through the window with a baby, her niece or cousin, in her arms.  i wave and she waves back hesitantly.  we find andee's car and we set off driving.  i have a square book, a detailed guide to the state.  we make a left on our way out of the school.  we are going down dirt roads.  we come across a flock of goats.  it's my mom i'm driving with and we're looking for a place to eat on our hour and a hlaf break.  i'm concerned now that the place we want to go is an hour or more away itself.  the road we are travelling on is rough, ridged with mud and rocks, narrow -- just wide enough for our car to fit throguh.  on either side are orchards, trees, crops.  "i've been here before in a dream," i say, and my mom seems interested but not surprised.  there'es a watermelon ont he floor and i cut myself a piece.  we get tothe main road just after i say that i think we need to take the interstate.  katherine dunn talking about her sexuality.  i ask her about living on applewood and she exclaims that she has never lived there.  i am hoping the things i sent her there are returned to me.  i am sorting prints and mailing labels from a stack of files.  i see mark blankenship for the first time in a long time.  he is not so impressed by my dream performance idea, though.  the fate of the britons under english rule  man in green beret suit  susan knowles, lucian rowland, in kitchen; i offer to make spaghetti squash but there is none, only the large "empire" squash, like a zucchini but larger.  i am wearing a velvet pillbox hat.  singing "it's a fire" by portishead 
2404 20060302122207 notes:  aunt gin to cut my hair, but i cannot find the two pictures i found while at work yesterday.  i dig through my bag, embarrassingly pulling out stacks of papers, feminine hygeine products, the like.  no pics.  when i finally give up, gin is waiting, impatiently but without betraying it.  i am to sit not at the barber's station, all the way int he back along the wall with a small cutout window above it, but rather at a laminate table with two attached plastic chairs that rotate, a la old fast food places  gin cuts my hair but i do not check to see the results.  instead i go to take my four pet rats, which actually look like minks or mongoose (mongeese?) and step out of the back of the salon into another dimension, pretty much -- all green hills and stone outcropping.  i am goign to let the rats loose to roam and romp around -- they are very playful and smart, and i am very attached to them.  suddenly our neighbor chuck's son tom appears.  he ahs two "rat terriers", whcih are known for chasing down rats and shaking them until the are dead.  i am so upset.  i am trying to tell him not to bring them out yet, until i am able to gather up the rats, but it is too late -- they are released and run across the field, having spotted the rats.  they are going to fight! i am in anguish.  later, trying to get to a concert for orchestra.  we have gone the back way, which turns into a treacherous climb up a dizzying and collasing metal stairway ont he outside of a building.  at some point danielle sered does not think that she can go on -- the metal steps are falling apart, and she is the last to climb, so no one can help her.  i throw down a rope and she is able to continue.  i am dizzy and nauseous too, looking at the vertiginous choice once we get in this back entrance, down two narrow steep flights of stairs, almost vertical.  also once must hoist oneself up fromt he platform outside at the  end of the metal stairs, up nearly two feet to the landing of the door -- then down again onto a narrow ledge before jumping to one of the stairs.  when we finally emerge downstairs i first nearly collide into a row of boom mikes or recording equipemnt that has been set up int eh back of an auditorium -- then i realize i have completely forgotten my viola.    that's okay, camille tels me, i can probably just fake having a viola up on stage -- no one will notice.   
2414 20060703110607 I drove and drove down long highways, out west but through wilderness forest, old logging routes now paved.  Where I stopped was a drained marshland now parched and cracked, with machinery in the middle of it, train tracks across it.  Sunny Becks was there and she was someone else simultaneously.  She told me to get back from the tracks and we both did, running across the dirt ridged deeply by drought.  As we ran we could hear the train coming and then saw it.  It was just the engine but it moved very fast and it was in constant danger of flying off the tracks, especially at this part where it whipped around a corner and switched tracks very suddenly.  When it passed Sunny wanted to go to the metal apparatus above the tracks -- scaffolding for a new building, it looked like, but they wre not going to do any further construction with it.  I eld her back with my arms and voice -- she was about to swing up tot the top of the scaffolding in a crane - catapult apparatus, but mechanized cranes were already lifting many large dumpsters high up int he air at exactly the level where she would be swung.  She wasn't aware of the dumpsters or the robotic arms and I didn't want her to be hurt.  There was a night installation of an outdoor Untitled show.  Franne Lee was about to leave.  There was a beautiful androgynous out-of-town guest, an old friend of mine, who was staying at our place.    In full sun I was walking around toward the chorus rehearsal.  I wasn't part of it but I was supposed to sing anyway so as to fit in.  It was war-time and everyone's activities were monitored closely.  Erika was in charge of smuggling me into this festival.  No one knew the words to the songs.  Mark Sloniker was walking arm in arm with my friend Mark from college.  I was being shown my dreams and how they corresponded to thirteen points of a ritual descent to and return from the underworld.  We only got to stage six or so.  The dreams were being presented to me in parcels wrapped in banana leaves.  They were being arrayed around the oval table in our dining room.  An important part of the mapping was the correspondence between the points opposite on the table, as well as the pairings of points next to each other, like the dreams within two separate packets presented at the same time, "Mother of Darkness" - "Mistress of Kindness". desceni into underworld fourteen stage initiation  
2415 20060516113407 at the busy street the wild child "from chicago" who had never seen either cars or trees suddenly darted across the six lanes of two-way traffic.  the cars miraculously stopped just short of her and she flitted from vehicle to vehicle.  the group of us at the edge of the road was astonished.   old lady's velcroed on purse and bandages got caught in the cars speeding by and dragged her along for a bit though i ran behind them shouting "stop".  they finally slowed and i disentangled her.  an old man driving and his coterie of old women in the car.  i felt sad.    there was the city across from roma, tejas, cuidad miguel aleman, sparkling in the sun and etched with rainbows and ridged hills that rose straight up.  now in my third trip there it seemed still as miraculoous as the first time but other people were with me and so that feeling of strangeness present when you travel on your own was absent or subdued.  but still i was lost in my own thoughts as i wandered the streets and i saw the city once more through fresh eyes as it glistened before me in sun that followed rain.  there was an artist whose studio we came upon.  there it was in the midst of scrub desert and farmland.  i thought about posting it to the kempleton wiki but then i felt foolish for not just looking at it now rather than anticipating some future filtering of it.  the building had no roof and no wall on one side and everything was dry and vibrant.  this rperson was a street revolutionary and a printmaker.  he had very few pieces of his own work up on the walls, however.  there were big file cabinets of his stuff and i hoped to look inside.  rick was there now and he suggested that we buy something but in reality i was content just to look.  out back there was a duck and ducklings of different colors that followed it around.  i called one of the ducklings and it came to me and i petted its feathers.  it was so soft and friendly.    then the adult duck started coming over and someone was hsising behind me.  at a house that wasn't my granny's, big, but now my granny lived there.  it was time for me to say goodbye and indeed my whole family was inteh car but i couldn't leave yet, for one reason or antoher.  first small children, my cousins, were hanging onto ym legs, not letting me go -- then i had to go to the bathroom.  my dad and mom were getting impatient.  sarah and kate were still young. 
2417 20030224093807 people in glass houses   I was in high school again, but it remains unclear whether I was a student or a teacher or some nebulous state in between.  I had to go to the bathroom, but the only one I could find was a palatial room walled completely with black glass.  I feared that people could see me as I went to the bathroom.  Indeed, people were looking in my direction and snickering.  But when I exited the bathroom and looked back on it, it seemed expressly designed so that people could see out but others could not see in.    Inside the main building, I wasn't listening to the instructions of Ms. Garcia, assistant principal.  Her three younger daughters were fighting, however, over who would get to take which glazed and fired ceramic item to class for show-and-tell.  There were two animal figures and a long, broken rectangualar piece.  Since the twins were the ones who were really arguing over this, one twin was going to put an animal figure in each of my hands behind my back. The other twin would come in and pick one of my hands and take the animal figure in it.  (The older sister would take the broken rectangular figure.)   My Uncle Thomas's wife, Audra, came in in a very fancy holiday dress with a velvet flocked Christmas bow--the sort you would put out on your door--on her neck with the tag still on it.  I walked into a classroom. My senior year English teacher was there, as was my childhood friend Laura.  I pulled up a desk next to hers.  We had been reading a long poem,and though it seemed class must have just begun, there were many notes I had missed.  Laura was showing me them.  Most notably was the notation about the "Irish-American Italian pope," somebody Claes or Claus.  I was doodling on my notebook; a picture of a man protesting in front of the towers of Malaysia.  My picture seemed alive.  In another distant dream, I was with my parents for some sort of holiday.  I told my dad I needed to go somewhere, so we hopped in the car/prop plane and set off.  I thought I told my dad the right destination--"Plato".  Only we wound up circling around a high mountain town. I was supposed to be giving my dad directions, I realized, so I told him to head west.    But when my dad said,"Gimme that map and let me take a look at it," we realized we were flying towards Tokyo, not Plato, which was to the south.  My dad turned the plane back towards home in disgust.  
2441 20060421104607 When I walked outside of Finer Things Gallery I let Kim know that a lady fromthe state tax department was coming by to inspect our walls -- in order to determine whether what we said we sold at the gallery was actually what we represented.  Kim was on her way out and so drove off, but I noticed that my car had been reparked in a funny way.  Examining it more closely, I saw that various wires and spark plugs had been pulled from the console and steering wheel and were dangling.  I wasn't really sure what to do so I tentatively reached out for the one that seemed most important and made a half-hearted attempt to plug it back in.  The radio was playing in the car, strangely, so I got inside to see if it would drive.  It was very responsive and soon I was hurtling on the narrow road through the sculpture garden at almost fifty miles an hour.  Almost too late I saw that another car, a red Honda, was coming down the sculpture garden road in the other direction.  They were going almost as fast as me and showed no signs of slowing.  So I threw the car in reverse and nerve-rackingly drove it between the sculptures.  MId-way down the road, the other car turned around and exited.  I kept going in reverse until I reached the back gate.  I was on foot now, and when a big dog came bounding up I thought it was Cash.  But it was not Cash, but a large black dog with enormous eyes of which you could only see the whites.  The dog was blind and walked with its legs splayed out.  It followed me around but I was scared of it even though it did nothing more than try to sniff me.  Its large white eyes were rolling around in its head as it walked.  When I got up by the door to let myself in again I could not find my keys.  The dog was right next to me and bit my hand. A group of teenagers were riding through the property on bicycles.  I secretly hoped the dog would be distracted by them and chase after them, leaving me alone to find a way to get away from it.  The teens came onto the porch.  "Oh, there's Ubu!" they said.  "Ubu?" I asked.  "Yew, we read a book about him.  Ubu Koi or Roy ..."  Ubu seemed reassured by there presence: he lay down on the deck, every once in a while lifting up his massive, donkey like ears and circling them around to hear what we were saying.  His head was enormous and did, indeed, look like a donkeys or a camels.  I went so far as to pet him behind the ears and under the chin.   
2443 20060920074814 An evil force, forces really, dwelled at the top of the four story house.  They were supposed to stay up there out of deference to a long-tradition of right-of-way, but recently they had started encroaching into the normal world.  The signs were numerous and spooky: A forlorn wooden child's chair that moved by itself.  Storms that came out of nowhere and pushed dead leaves into spiralling towers.  Spirits that entered a room and took you elsewhere.  A van that drove itself (but when we looked closely we saw there was a woman on the underside of the carriage -- she was trying to take spy pictures of us with her camera in order to steal our soul).  We drove into Donna, actually the edge of Harlingen just near the arroyo, to regroup and discuss our plan. Their big attack would happen tonight.  On the resaca I saw again flat-bottomed boats with their hulls of concrete.  olly and I drove over one bridge, then turned to find another, with an evil spirit in fast pursuit.  At night in the third floor of the house we got ready for the final showdown. My dad put on a pink and black wig which was tainted by the spirits but luckily it didn't affect him.  I knew the spirits were coming and so I bundled my sisters into my mom and dad's room, which was the den of my parents' house.  I stayed on the edge of the room looking out into the kitchen, watching the guaze curtain that separated the room billow in unnatural air.  Under the big tent the announcer's voice drew our attention to the open doors at the top of the tent. At the bottom of a stairway we couldn't see, hundreds of trained baboons waited for the signal.  When it was given they would climb the stairs and sit among us as friends.  "The baboons' normally silken fur is given a silver sheen by the daily application of volcanic dust and ash," the announcer said.  The baboons ome of the baboons would pose together.  They had climbed each as far as they were supposed to and now the signal was given to descend.  They would be replaced by bonobos, bunnies, other animals who would climb and hop their way to the top.  Some people did not want to give the baboons up.  I climbed down the steps of the big top.  THere was a special stairway reserved for the rabbits so they wouldn't get crushed but people were walking in it, so only one big chocolate lop-eared climbed up it.  The bulk of the animals waited with their trainers beyond the circus tent doors. 
2444 20040629131607 My friend Nathan's website had not been updated since the fall of 2002, but we were looking at it projected onto the side of a building.  On the building's upper level, in Jenny Holzer LED light-like display, the equation: "sensuality = sex + nationality".  The moldy disused mildewed white courtyard -- the ruined ornamental trees, holly and ficus.  The one lone ficus still standing healthy I replanted in a larger tub, but without adequate soil I was forced to use the slimy rotten smelling dirt from another diseased plant's pot, although as I planted it around the tree it turned into mounds of freshly washed and folded laundry, added to periodically by smoothskinned laughing Mexican women.  My own body spiralling smaller, as I twisted outside a supermarket, until at last I turned into a rusty old aluminum can.  The reliquary house, known locally as "the relic", standing forlorn and not even that old looking, although it was ancient, in a small wooded grove.  It was soon to be demolished to build condos, and great slag heaps of burned trees and earth and sand stood behind it.  Across the street was the crowded graveyard, where masoleums and monuments of all sizes and eras stood and toppled next to each other in confusion.  Down the road the crazy series of pleasure palaces of a role-playing sort: the pretend Islamic mosque, the Lord of the Rings world, a pavillion devoted to space exploration -- all these stood in the stripped out fields, along fields barren of vegetation.  This was all in the outskirts of TN, but it could have been west Texas or the flat lands of the midwest or Long Island for all the unending monotony of barren plains and incessant blaring sun.  Someone later said Long Island was like New England, a claim I had to disagree with: "Maybe on the far east end of the North and South Forks," I said.  "But Nassau has been almost completely Bronxified."  We almost fought.    32 degrees in the middle of summer, and we stood outside in the light of morning, uncertain of how to pack the car.  Earlier, my dad had replaced all the windows in the car with storm glass just in case of an air strike.  He hadn't been going to do it but just days before we'd all sat in the car as storms had rolled through. "If it had been three times as bad," sis Sass had said, "it would have killed us instantly."  I hadn't noticed, as I'd had a single task I had to attend to in the back seat of the car. 
2467 20030414080808 The June Cleaver-type woman sitting next to me in the car as we drove around the back roads of Mount Sinai, my hometown.  "I've been to Spain," she said, "and Paris."  She'd gone to these places to take a class on writing combination thank you/apology letters.  "Can you imagine?" she asked me as we rode together in the back seat.  I thought perhaps she was making fun of the course, but instead she was explaining how difficult it had been for her.    "Can you imagine?" she said again.  "Me, having to apologize?  It was hard to do."  Earlier in the dream, I dreamt I walked the city alone at night--as I used to dream, at the beginning of each night starting when I was twelve until I left my parents' house, that I ran--by myself and at the utmost of speed--down to and back away from the harbor, night following me in a black net, overtaking me as I rounded the bend by the harbor and started up the hill, no stars or moon in sight.  I dreamt I walked through Nashville just by before the intersection of 8th Avenue and Division Street--just after where the train trestle runs over the street and time and filth have eaten away at the graffiti and dirty limericks on the walls of the trestle.  I ran in darkness, no light.  I turned just before the intersection and ran directly into the chainsawplace that stands at the corner.  It was larger in my dream and I knew I should not be in there by myself, alone at night.  All the walls were made of particle board and plywood; only the cases were lit, illuminating hundreds of chainsaws, all of which looked like guns with protective muzzles over their barrels.  The light emanating from the cases gave the room a sinister, warm glow.  I knew I had to get out of the shop, fast.    The front door of the shop was unlocked, which made me very worried.  Anyone could walk in and take some chain saws.  Also, if the door was unlocked, perhaps the owner of the shop had been in there even as I had walked through it.  Indeed, the owner of the shop was there.  He was a member of  the Rosicrucians , who were having a meeting in his shop even as I had run through it.  The owner appeared, working a sharpening wheel, sparks flying before him.  we were in a workshop/garage.  I tried to get out but the owner detained me, asking me polite questions.   There was a college quad filled with stuff--books, paper, toys--blowing around.  I had visited there before, in the same dream, and now I had returned. 
2471 20030524085008 I looked down at my hands: my fingers and thumbs were inexplicably bloody.    My nanny with the fancy blouse and the bra with a bejeweled bow. I am serving antipasta; the crowds in the house, my other granny's house, are starving and impatient.  We are waiting for the pope to come downstairs from his "People's Meeting" so he can bless our meal and ea with us.  At my granny's kitchen table, sis Sass makes a dificult but necessary  ethical decision.  "Thanks for helping me see clearly, guys," she says.  Suddenly a third eye appears on her beautiful face, just to the right of her right eye.  It is dim and small first and then takes solid shape.  there's a tiny, handmade ink tatoo of an eye, like a teardrop, below her real eye.    Sass says, "Thanks for drawing my eye tatoo, om," and as she says it a fourth eye appears to the left of her left eye.  The efect is beautiful and spooky; I feel like we're in the presence of something almost sacred, certainly something very important.  And yet I think my mom and I are the only ones at the table who can see that Sass has two extra eyes.   I am going to change, for we are about to eat and I suddenly ralize I have no top on.  I go to the studio that first RIck and now my dad have rented on a whim. It's Wes's old place, whoever that was--some child star now trying to forget his early fame and regard.  My dad is suddenly knocking on hte door--he's looking for his loaf of honey bread, buried somewhere in a mess of luggage and bedding.  MIT, LA style, is just across the way, and I want to visit to check out their "minorities in engineering and music" program.  I go out back: a precocious child has been wandering on her own for several hours; its night now and her paents still haven't come for her.  I point her in the direction of home; at that moment, her mom, oyung and fresh-faced and somewhat addled-looking, appears on the scene.  "She's oer here," I say, but her mom is looking for her in an outhouse.  Perhaps Rick and I will get a plot of land in the field of flowers for sale behind the studio.  I am driving down the sreets of LA in golden late afternoon with a library copy of a book by Franz Fanon.  I am really interested in it and I am trying to read as I drive, but i know this is a bad idea, for I keep almost hitting people.  Here in LA they are beginning to put up good found art everywhere: I spot a chart paper transcript of a conversation my sis and mom had just that day.
2489 20030117085007 The Ties That Bind   I was in my grandmother's house, again (only this time it was more like her actual house).  My aunt had stormed in and out of the room, angry because she didn't have a lot of time to get ready for work.  My grandmother followed her, hoping to placate her, and returned about five minutes later, badly shaken.  "She shouted at me and then tried to push me down," she said, referring to my aunt. "She finally did hit me and push me down.  Then she stood over me, one leg on either side of my chest, shaking her wet hair and saying, 'I am a horse.'"   I was so sad.  I gave my grandma a hug, but that had the undesired effect of making her stop talking.  I wanted to talk wih my dad but he was out somewhere--running errands or eating.    Somehow I was transported to a funeral home, where my mom's family was all gathered for my Pop-Pop's funeral. In my dream I thought this was odd--"Why should we have a second funeral?" I thought to myself.  (My Pop-Pop's actual funeral was in September.)  The funeral home was a series of "great rooms"; it was one large open space with different areas for sitting or viewing.  As you walked in the door, a long low wall ran alongside you on your right for about twenty feet--then there was a step down to get into the first sitting area.  This same construction was repeated twice in a row, creating two more sitting areas.  Then the low wall looped around at the end of the building to continue on the opposite side.  The seating was firm, faux-leather upholstered benches.  The one I sat near had a bowl of candies on a table in front of it and a bowling alley ball return machine vent/hand-dryer next to it.  My entire family came in and announced that they were going to the viewing, which was apparently being held at a separate location--this building was just a gathering place for us.  I was working on some sort of commemorative project and so I decided not to go. "I've seen him before," I thought to myself--and in my dream, I was thinking that I'd seen him before at his actual funeral in September.  Then, the project I was working on turned into a collage made of colored rice paper.  I was making a body out of a rich red, a torso out of a lighter and more transparent red, a bowl-shaped hat out of a soft kelly green. It was very small, and I was going to bring it to some later meeting--which I eventually did attend, and at which we built a life-size tree out of pvc pipes, clay and real leaves.   
2489 20030330124807 tonantzin   Rick and I were walking through a large field, bordered on one side by a quiet swath of highway and, in the far distance on all other sides, beautiful treees in full summer bloom.  The fields were planted with all sorts of crops; in various portions of the interconnected fields, farm workers were busy collecting the harvest.  The day was warm and the clouds were low and fluffy white along the horizon: they looked thick, like they had been painted with oils.  Rick and I were walking through the field, eating as we went along--we picked up some strawberries and some string beans, and pulled up a few carrots and scallions to save for later.  Farther off, there were workers in traditional indigenous dress, Mexican Mayan, pulling up root vegetables and picking over cotton and beans.  Rick and I were walking through a fields that were little more than stubble, looking for anything left over.  There was little left besides the scattered remains of roots or mown-down stalks.      Abput a quater-mile off, little children were playing and farm workers were taking their lunch break, seated at rough-hewn picnic tables under the shade of large trees.  I had spotted a wild raspberry bush ripe with fruit--though in my head I knew it was only May, and it seemed strange that the fruit should be ripe already.  We went to pick some--the berries were black and large, but the leaves were distinctly those of a wild raspberry--but the fruit was bitter and full of seeds.  I ate two and then told Rick we shouldn't eat anymore; they'd make us sick.    We went over to join the group under the trees.  Some had on traditional dress and some just shorts and tee-shirts. There were several tables and we approached the nearest. There were two women on one side--one sitting with her baby--and another woman, only in her forties, it seemed, but with long white hair, pulled back.  I asked, "Puedemos assitamos aqui?" which in my head meant, "Can we sit down here?"  The woman with long white hair, who had been speaking an indigenous language, turned to us and spoke in English, "So you want to sit here? You can sit here,"  She gestured for us to join her on the bench.  I motioned back to our car, parked by the side of the road.  I would need to run back to it and get our lunch.    "Ah," the woman said.  "Lunchicans."   Then I was off running fast over the picked-over earth; the sun was warm and there was a slight breeze pushing me forward.   Ki'i ba' wilik  
2490 20030810105807 dream of 8/9  The staging of the dance--the two renowned dancers from Louisville running down  the city street, the cool dark shadows of skyscrapers hemming them in and pushing them forward beyond a phlanx of soldiers. The dancers the only splash of vibrant color emerging from the pink glow of the distance like banners and garlands on a long-ago feast day.  And the soldiers behind them the same grim grey as the skyscrapers, inevitable and always at their heels.   At the market, some 200 yards down the street from where I stood to watch the performance, the pursued turn on their pursuers, the dancers turn on the soldiers and, wrestling with them, distill them to two representative forms and fling them to the ground.  The two soldiers do a great sequence of clown-dancing--the dancers are about to shove them down a manhole into prison, the underworld, and the soldiers pierouette and squat to make their bodies an impossible shape to fit down the manhole.  But the dancers, no longer the important figures, fold up the soldiers' bodies and we follow them with our eyes as they descend down a short tunnel to vast underground caverns, the lair of Ali Baba and Al Capone, and to one side a geisha temple where one of the pursued dancer's helpers, who has somehow made it down the tunnel too, is exploring, dressed in a geisha costume, tricking the men who have been shoved down the tunnel to come into her banquet hall and eat the banquet spread there--it has been there for all eternity; it never changes.  Outside, earlier, against a backdrop of hills and moraines I walked my car across a bust intersection as though it were a bike. I walked it the wrong way through one lane of traffic, to a McDonald's supposedly close to Bryce's shop.  I needed to use a phone, and I had thought that I would have to walk much further away from the shop to get to one.  Then I was on my bike, almost colliding with oncoming traffic making a left--my light red, theirs green and yet me, foolishly, out in the middle of the intersection.  Earlier still a house abandoned after an old man's death.  Through the falling down stairs, the walls of splintered plywood, across mattresses heaped on the floor I chased a parasite that threatened to destroy everything.  I believed it was housed in three beautiful boys, one six, one eight, one ten, who ran through the house playing.  I chased after them with a long curved knife in my mouth; when I caught them I would have to kill them. 
2513 20031207144408 that fist aimed at both of us  With my mom, Amy Simrell, etc. making dinner in an old kitchen.  A beautiful and puzzling old freestanding cabinet--about two feet tall, of blond oak, with drawers of different sizes, some impossibly thin, but all openable, with small grooves to store silverware, or dessert spoons, or formal serving ware, or fancy items.    An amalgam of Amy's daughter Leslie and my cousin Liz, lounging on her bed, asking me if wanted to sneak outsid during the last 15 minutes fo daylight for "an English tan".  Liz-Leslie surrounded by piles of women's fashion magazines.  The scene shifted.  A cuddly animatronic-looking bear with blue splotches on his fur was wandering around in thick black night, clamboring into various cabins, all of them seedy bars or clubs. Why?--For food or entertainment, I forget which--but the bear would also perform at each venue.  The bear always left the window to its own tiny cabin open so that it could ge back in.  There was another crony, perhaps another enchanted animal, that would go around in it, although they would rarely end up at the same place.  One night on their way back home they were all metamorphosized (back?) into little kids.  Celina Ridriguez, the angelic-faced perpetually dirty spitfire, was there along with two boys and a roomful of beds, their home.  Celina had forgotten, again, all the letter names and sounds of the alphabet.  A burly Mexican man was there, lying in a bed next to his daughter, abusing her with pinches and slaps.  I called an abuse counseling hotline and made him talk to it, but I couldn't figure out how to get the girl out of the bed.  I had replaced the children's previous babysitter, and I was figuring out the rules of the household.  We were elsewhere, checking out times for the movies, though we knew we weregoing to go home first and go to the movies later.  I had promised to go, but a force was trying to prevent me.  I woke up back in the shack, in the bed that had been moved into the corner for me.  I was skinny and naked and someone had beaten me.  I looked up to see a giant bloody barefoot coming down from the ceiling.  I had just enough time to perceive it emerging, like the foot of a wrathful god, before it crushed my head down toward the bed.  I looked up again, trying to rail against it, and it did the same.  I had no time to react, just to take the blow. Then I rolled out of the bed, got dressed close to the floor, and crawled to the door to get out, all bloody. 
2515 20030203093207 The Beautiful Blue Danube   I was playing viola in an orchestra and the c-string kept getting more and more frayed.  The outer metal coating kept coiling off.  I got to the end of the piece--there was a repeating figure of a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note followed by a quarter, rising and then falling.  We were playing a waltz, but I didn't realize it--I kept trying to play it in 4/4 time.        Double Dare   I was in the darkened gym of my high school trying to get out of participating in an Olympic-style competition featuring tumbling and rope- and wall-climbing.  My high school gym teacher, Ms. Strassenberg, was exhorting us to participate. RIMboy and Jen were taking camping lessons with an older white-bearded guy in a Hawaiian shirt with binoculars around his neck.  The man had found out about a program Jen and Sean had started--a non-profit that taught outdoor survival and orienteering skills to inner city kids--and the older man wanted to become a patron of the program.  Later on I was getting in a car in front of my parents' house.  The whole family was going to a street festival that was being held in downtown Nashville (or some other location a little more urban than Long Island).  My dad was driving the car, which was very crowded--my mom, my sisters, and a man from Untitled were sitting in the back of a compact four-door car, while another woman and I were sharing the front passenger-side seat.  I was yelling at my mom because she wouldn't tell me if it would freeze overnight.  I wanted to know if I should bring my housplants in.  I yelled that I wouldn't go to the festival and asked for my mom's housekeys.  When I went into the house to check on my plants, the family left.  The car turned into a station wagon as it rounded the bend of the driveway.  I actually hadn't expected my family to leave without me, so I was kind of shocked.  I stayed home pouting.  Somehow my sister Kate invited me to a festival called a  priyad .  It was a combination of outdoor music festival and series of physical challenges.  After we returned, we were searching for my sister Sarah to see if she wanted to attend the next one in a few weeks.  As soon as you returned from the priyad, you had to decide if you wanted to attend the next one, and submit your application form immediately.  I woke up after this part of the dream.  When I went back to sleep I dreamed that Rick was preparing to attend the priyad, too, but his friends were making fun of him.  
2524 20060323123407 I had to revise my senior thesis to include an analysis of my two years of teaching experience.  Yet it was not just that: in fact, it was as though these past four years I have been out of school I was supposed to have been working on a thesis, one that instead of going outwards to others for ethnographic interviews, was supposed to have focused on a conversation with myself.  But now it was due, and I had only my old draft of my college thesis written, and Ms. Servellon, my boss from Landrum, was my thesis advisor.  This upset me, because I detested her.  What I ultimately decided to do was do a compare and contrast between my experiences in college and teaching -- or was it between teaching and life in Nashville?  It was very convoluted and I was writing in very small print on my front page, which was a table of contents for the whole paper, about what would need to go where.  If I could get it outlined, I figured, I could write the whole thing that evening no problem.  From my notes of this morning: "the intense disgust i felt for ms. servellon".  This in my dream made me feel physcially ill.  Walking with Katherine Dunn through the alleyway at first covered then open beneath nighttime sky.  The clouds were low above downtown Nashville but we were elevated so that we seemed to look down at the city -- perhaps from where the Music Row roundabout is, but there were no buildings around, only abandoned lots.  Above the buildings downtown the sky was yellow and green and looked and smelled like tornadoes -- ozone thick inthe air, and clouds swirling.  Katherine and I looked at each other and said, "It's scary."  It was unclear whether it was due to weather or war.  Riding with Kevin Diggett -- I came by 113 Shore Road to pick him up in an old car -- my parents' old Chevrolet?  Before he came out I chased two plastic bags -- one a grocery bag, the other a ziploc -- down the driveway and into the side lot of the Jensens -- but I could never catch them before they blew into the woods.  In the strange hallway once part of a hospital or school now abandoned by civic authorities but still used, and haunted somehow by presences that one felt inhabit spaces between doorways, I met up with Tiffany, which is who Katherine Dunn had become as we walked back the alleyway in darkness.  There was something I kept forgetting to give her and indeed I have forgotten it now.  Cash the dog was there, and then two cats fighting -- three after I tried to chase them all out with brooms.  
2529 20060331112608 When I went into the English-feeling room (it was small and utilized a space under the stairs and had some glass bottles along the side of the wall like an apocatherary's shop) I saw Will Branham there.  He smelled faintly of Paul Garritano.  Alas, I learned, his head would be chopped off and I would have to carry it around with me, but like the Wondrous Head of Bendigeidfran it would talk and accompany me as though it were not separate from the body.  And so I looked underneath the gurney with its pristine white sheet upon it and I found the head there, just as Will had said.  Later, my cousin Samantha and another person, a child of about ten, and I were standing along a hung up line of white sheets strung across a clothesline.  The ends of the sheets were staked so that we seemed to stand along a row of billowing white tents.  Sam was arguing with me over whether a word I used even existed.  The word sounded like "suppository" but this was not the word, though Sam kept spelling that word over and over.  Later still I walked over to the old Blamey's house, which now was up on a slight ridge and which had been renovated completely by Chuck and Nan. As I walked I took out twenty-one small black pebbles, actually each a sort of uneven slate and pumice mixture, the size of baby teeth.  As I walked toward the house I felt a wind which was the wind of spirits, and it was stronger than it had ever been.  It almost knocked me over it was so forceful.  I thought about turning back but knew that it was my destiny that led me to this house over and over.  I turned to see where the old garage and playhouse had been converted into a modern home of several stories.  Chuck and Nan's son and his wife and their children could live there on weekends.  But this was, on some levels, illegal, since they didn't own the home.  A young man with dark hair appeared beside me.  He was a friend though I can't now recall his name or face.  We decided to peek inside the house together -- the strange open windows with their cellophane bowed plants, the whole house decorated as though it were a new house in Victorian times, but with the allowance of light and air.  But as we stepped toward the door a police on motorcycle appeared, just in front of use, between ourselves and the doorway.  Later, "naughty" picture cards that were actually devotionals for Hindu godesses.  In one the goddesses were kissing each other, calling the world into creation.  The caption underneath read "Happy divas (devas?").  
2535 20030428094607 L'etat, c'est moi    Two small girls were running around a darkened parking lots while teenaged boys in flashy cars swerved around recklessly.  A tall lanky man was looking at the stars, calling the small girls to his side.  Beneath his apparently unruffled tone was a dark current of explosive anger.  His skinny body was tense; he was holding back his frustration with the girls, who he did not try to restrain or keep from running into the paths of oncoming cars.   I was running after the girls, who were each no more than two or three. I was trying to figure out how the tall man was related to them.  My Aunt Ginny appeared on the scene, her hair cut short and feathered.  It was suddenly bright daylight, and she was emerging fromt he side of a house.    "I met her in a bar," the lanky man said, "and I told her, 'Tomorrow's Saturday, and I don't have to wake up early.'"  The implication was that they could lay in bed all day.    Teh girls were named Amy and something else that was spelled in a trendy way and ended inexplicably in an "a".  I had a tub of magnetic letters that they were trying to take; I wound up sitting with each of them individually and helping them spell out their names.  I only had time to work with Amy, though.  The other girl had grown older--she was about four.  We were inside the kindergarten wing of some public school.  It was well-lit and the walls and floors were warm yellow speckled linoleum.  I had a workbook from the fifties.  It was full of ancient grammatical terms--a combination of French, Latin, and old typesetters colloquialisms.  It had a style of illustrations typical of the fifties and early sixties--a line drawings in black ink, colored in by a splash of brick orange that did not match the outlines of the pictures.  There was a section on proper nouns, but they were called "etats".  I wanted my students to learn about grammar, but not this way. My mom and dad, however, thought it was a good idea.      There was an anthropology honors colloquium.  My old friend Shelley was giving a talk.  I was really worried that I would have to present my research from over three years ago again, without any time to review it or remember it.  My mom was naked on the back porch, talking to my dad about her friend Nick Micros's studio, and how he could paint in natural light all day long.  "He told me that he could just paint the exact light and color that he sees," she told my dad. I felt betrayed by her; I had thought that she was seeing the tall mean man. 
2564 20060709124008 We were on the bus waiting for the rest of the students to return.  I was not a student but not a teacher.  I was on this fieldtrip as a chaperone for some reason.  No one had thought to check in the students as they returned to the bus -- no one had even counted them.  So it was unclear who was missing.  From the back of the bus teachers and chaperones spoke the names of the missing students, with other students' voices popping up to add names.  There were about six students missing.  We saw the missig students hanging out, unconcerned and unaware that the bus was about to leave.  They were brought back to the bus and lectured briefly.  I was talking with the young music teacher who was in charge. First though we passed a white panther lounging in a tree, shaded.  Its eyes followed ours.  I soundlessly looked back at Rick, pointing out the panther.  Later Rick and the music teacher talked about it.  "There was a mechanical panther back there, did you see it?"  I soehow couldn't believe the panther had been mechanical.    The music teacher and I were talking about what would need to be done when the kids returned to school.  I said that at the least they should meet with the students in small groups to go over again the expectations for behavior on a school trip.  "The rules they should follow on a school trip should be the same ones tehy follow in school.  Even more so because they are publicly representing the school."  I paused, continued: "We could sit here all day and talk about whether the rules of school are even worth following" -- here I looked the music teacher int eh eye; we both did not feel the rules of normal public school were worth following.  "But it is important that there be some sort of guidelines so those rules would be a place to start."  I drew out a diagram with the two prongs the discussion should take -- one on responsibility and adherence to law, the other on self-knowledge.  The teacher was looking at me, asking if I would give the lecture.  But I didn't want to give it.  I said I was too easy.  It would turn into a discussion and the school wanted the problem taken care of, not discussed.  That's why I got my glasses, I said, to seem sterner, but it hadn't worked.  In the back of my head a slight feeling of disgust at the school system and arbitrarily telling kids what to do.  In the river we were passing there was first one, then another white bear swimming int he water.  Perhaps they were polar bears.  THe music teacher saw them too and they were not animatronic this time. 
2570 20030120083008 Go, Team, Go   I had wandered into a practice for the school basketball team.  My high school gym teacher was supervising the practice, which was little more than a fracas. About one hundred people--much later, I discovered, divided into four separate teams--were jockeying for points at four separate baskets, one on each side of the dimly-lit gym.  Three of the teams had the same exact uniforms, and there plenty of players who, like me, had wandered in late and therefore had just street clothes on anyway.  I finally figured out what basket I was supposed to score on and tried to set up a shot.  I kept passing the ball to two other players, one on either side of the basket, hoping one of us would take the shot.  But the people I was passing to would not move very much to catch the passes.  In fact, one player was just sitting patiently in her rolling chair, waiting for the shots to come to her.   Watching the Detective   I was travelling in Northern Mexico by bus.  By the side of the road, on brushy slopes, great Mayan stone heads lay toppled and covered by brush.  (Many of them actually looked like Southeast Asian Buddha heads.)  A man on foot was investigating the ruins: indigenous people still lived among them, and the man was some sort of government official or aid worker.    I'm Not Angry Anymore   With my childhood friend Laura I was standing in a strip mall parking lot, trying to pry metal bars off of telephone poles using hammers and crowbars.  (We were going to use the metal bars to hang up artwork.)  Workers had just installed the bars, which were about a foot-and-a-half long, so we could pry underneath the bars with the claw of the hammer, over and over again until they came off.   The parking lot was wide open and we were not being at all covert about our operation.  I was not surprised when a group of three professionals stood outside thir SUV staring at us from about 100 feet away.  I walked over to them and pretending to be looking in the store front directly in front of which they were parked.  "What are you doing over there?" the man in the group asked.  "Oh me?  Anger management.  I'm a teacher," I said.  "Oh," nodded the short-haired blond woman.  "I'm a teacher too--I understand."  I didn't understand, since it seeemed a pretty stupid explanation to me, but the people seemed to buy it.  "What's she doing?" the man asked, gesturing towards my friend Laura.  "Her?  Oh, I don't know her," I said.  "But I suppose she's doing some anger management too."  The blond-haired woman nodded knowingly.  
2577 20060524122807 1) walking through the corridor that is my old elementary school foyer mapped onto the entrance of the Cohen Building.  I realize that I must help deliver the crude drawings which are the entries of my former classmates into a fall drawing contest sponsored by the school.  i love these drawings.  they are spontaneous and unstudied and free, although some of them are filled with the cliches of little kids' drawings -- pretty girls with lots of skirts and m-birds and clouds and rainbows, autumn leaves falling, pumpkins.  Ticket terminals, Grand Central Station style, are mounted on one side of the wall  2) my classmates from high school have existed in a parallel dimension these past ten years; they are preserved here in eternal adolescence on the steps of the school, milling about waiting for the reunion picnic.  I am honestly happy to see everyone, happy at the same time to not really care.  there are the same cliques as back in high school still in place but what i find wonderful and liberating is that i don't feel compelled to sit with anyone or be with anyone, as one sometimes did in high school.  rather i am drifting in and out of groups, really listening to and looking at people for the first time ever, without being concerned about how others might feel about my actions.  i see kerri scroope and am surprised to see her ousted from the cool circle, her face tanned and leathery and ascetic, as though she has lived the life of an indian mystic these past ten years.  her face is filled with knowledge as if she has had revelations of the nature of life and so she is relegated to sit with the old pariahs of the high school social caste.  3)  walking through the lunchroom tables set up outside, i try to avoid giving more than a casual wave and a sincere smile to anyone (it will be too tempting otherwise to sit down with one person and thus miss out on taking it all in).  i am nonethless intercepted by Jessica Pollack, who is suddenly and inexplicably very nice to me, talking about Aileen Gearon's foray into fashion school ("a four-year program!" she beams).  i will have to talk with aileen about some projects i am doing, i tell jessica, and i mean it -- but i also tell her i am getting anxious for her because they are about to announce the winners of the drawing contest and, as her drawing is one of the entries, she must change into a strange baton-twirler's outfit in order to stand up on stage as the prize is being announced.  i genuinely don't want her to miss this opportunity.  i am proud for her in a strange way. 
2589 20061011082611 five bunches of spinach and the old religion man from russia who had never talked on a phone, just hte electric impulses of vegetables.  the rube goldberg buckets of vegetable juice contraption.  sarah and kate ont he rollercoaster as small children; video footage.  sarah raises her voice in the hallway talking with kate and mom and cousin samantha.  We tried to adjust the wedding string with the ribbons on it, placed in Edna and Steve Giffen's yard, so that Rick's dad could stand underneath it.  The garland-string was over twenty feet long, but from the middle the two sides would not adjust evenly because of knots in the curly ribbon.  I untied the ribbon by having Jimmy step through it somehow in a small gesture.  My aunt went to get us a chair to tie the other side too.  I was sitting with myy sisters and I remembered that I would need my passport.  In a room with piles of everyone's stuff, I tried to get on my clothes without being too immodest in front of Lou Lasser.  I thoguht about calling my sister Kate because now I realized I had never packed my passport, it was in the strongbox and she could get it for me.  I went outside with my mom and she asked about the front gardening she had done or rather told me "I brought Ginny Tanner outhere and asked her point blank what she thought of everything.  The impatiens have been coming up well" -- there were a bunch of impatiens around, tucked in to deep planting boxes built into the ground out of long pieces of plank wood.  There were shovels of wood shoved into the ground with wooden square tops.  Back in the window i looked to see a fuzzy orange and white kitty sitting in the kitchen window (but there was a new kitchen window midway between the old one and the bathroom window).  "That's Bob," my dad said and i knew it was a new cat and i wondered if my mom was upset.  "We put the watermelons back there.  Watermelons only on ________ property." said my mom and it was only when I turned around that I realized that she and dad had put in a garden where the euonymous had been and in the entryway into Blameys.  There were neat long orderly rows of eggplant and pepper and canteloupe and I suppose watermelon.  There were many eggplants on the bushes, and I said so.    The sea came.  It came from Blameys and sprung up suddenly and rose and swallowed the garden.  My mom and my dad and I gasped in sudden disappointement that the harvest would ikely be ruined.  "If it recedes we can try to clean off the plants and save them," I said, but the sea rose higher, just to the edge of our feet. 
2600 20060304110007 At the end of my parents' driveway some small children running across the road despite cars coming.  We go across the street to the Jensen's house.  Inside, modern layout and furniture -- I meet one of the "sons", whose name I must ask him to repeat several times -- it's "Capitol".  Later I meet another son with another strange name beginning with "P" -- it is not "Porfi", but something similar sounding that is also political.  The home is also a fancy restaurant and so we are sitting down at a full table with about seven people.  Our waiter is bringing over the others' food already, but I am still looking at the menu trying to decide what to get -- he hasn't taken my order yet.  The waiter begins walking away without taking my order so I raise my hand.  He comes over, evidently annoyed, and I forget what I was about to order.  I hem and haw, looking over the menu, and finally ask if they just have "tofu and vegetables".  He walks away with, "I'll check and see what they have in the back."  The person next to me begins complaining about the waiter and his service but I am silent.  He comes back several minutes later with plates and plates of vegetarian food -- miniature cabbage rolls, stuffing in clam shells with and without tomato sauce, stuffed artichokes.  The other people at the table are almost aghast with how much food is coming out, as they are mid-way through their own meals, but the waiter and I urge them to eat.  I turn to thank the waiter, saying, "You are having a pretty rough day, huh?" He nods.  Without communicating in words we forgive each other and wish each other well; without words I thank him for his generosity and his graciousness and he does the same for me.  It is a very peaceful and grateful feeling, to know that as humans we can be kind to one another. I want to hug him but knowing that would be inappropriate I merely thank him again and ask him to thank the kitchen for preparing such delicious and beautiful food.  Then the task of eating begins.  Later on line for the restroom -- there are actually two rows of stalls, one above the other -- the top row more for little kids who can be lifted up, or nimble adults.  Later still in a classroom receiving a lecture on why we did not win the basketball game.  "How many of you were late coming in to the tournament today?" coach asks, and over half of us, including me, who was roped into this only minutes before the game, raise our hands.  We are going to be on a regimen of greater discipline.  Later still the long-lost sisters and brothers of some of our teachers return. 
2619 20030527083807 There was a training for hundreds of police officers; we had all assembled in the parking lot of a school or some sort of administration building.  A man was twirling a small hand gun next to me.  He had just been ordered to report to basic training.  He was older and kind of looked like my childhood friend Gloria Kane's dad.  He pointed his handgun at first one co-worker, then another.  He squeezed the trigger each time.  The fourth time, he turned away and pointed the gun into the air.  A thin stream of smoking liquid fell from it.   There were many women at this strange assembly, all of them inappropriately dressed for combat or basic training.  Many of them were very attractive, but with excessive amounts of makeup.  I recognized a bunch of people from the Rio Grande Valley.  I realized that I wasn't ging to handgun training because I didn't have a gun.  I'd wandered over to where Beth Gilmore was sitting, her hair styled in an elaborate woven crown.      "Oh," she said.  "Are you coming to tell me the training's beginning?"  I hadn't been, but we walked over to where the remaining people without hadguns were standing.  A figure clad in half-burqa, half-late 80s flowered jogging set was standing before the group, doing aerobic exercises.  We were supposed to follow along.  I walked to the back, where some supervisors were standing.  "Is this for real?" I asked.  "Couldn't we actually do something that would prepare us for a dangerous situation--like martial arts or a self-defense class?"  "We've found that this helps," said one woman, trying to keep a straight face as the other supervisor made fun of my voice.  "Cardiovascualr exercise and all."  I decided I would just refuse to do the exercises and practice tae kwan do on my own.  Then I realized we were getting on long, speedy passenger trains from Amtrak.  On the train were many people from my high school.  Amy Weidner, Eileen Gearon, and some others had green, white and black on.  I slowly realized it was St. Patrick's Day.  Later I was in a great darkened hall, talking to a man interested in buying a large painted canvas of Rick's.  I kept trying to wake up so that I could check my e-mail and see if he had written me.  Ealier I saw my friend Pauly, in a perpetually darkened corner of the city.  The inaccessible and unlit streets were actually painted backdrops.  For some reason in my dream I'd thought Pauly had died and so I was really happy to see him.  Then I learned he had moved to Nashville a long time ago, while we were all still in high school.  He and  Brandon  had been casual acquaintances. 
2625 20060417083808 I put my purchases from the dollar store on the counter and waited for the woman to turn back around and ring them up.   Then Erika was there in the shop, though it was almost two and she was supposed to be somewhere else, because she was filling in for someone who hadn't shown up when they were supposed to.    I asked a question about culture's effect on gender, which made most everybody groan.  "Animals Mollusca", directed by a Lithuanian fellow (I could tell from the spelling of his last name).  Though the title sequence showed a number of cartoon mollusks and bivalves rocking back and forth and opening and closing, the opening sequence, narrated by the director, who had suddenly acquired a thick Scottish brogue, showed a pen-and-inked, hand colored scene of North Dakota, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. As the boundary lines of early settlements there appeared and disappeared, the narrator talked about the --- Railway Line, which had started off "zooming across the Dakotas" and had expanded into Minnesota and beyond.  We saw the train whip across the states and the workers build more tracks when they ran out somewhere in Michigan -- then the camera panned out to show the dotted line of the train moving across the map of Canada all the way to the top, to the ever-changing islands of the Artic sub-circle, which were green with summer and distinct from one another now but soon would be covered with ice and one solid mass.  We saw on themap briefly "Sophia Loren Island" -- then the narrator let us know about the world's largest diamond, made and still hidden by one of the islands in this area.  They passed the coal mines off Alaska's farthest borders; these disappeared in the map back into the ocean and ice began to fill up everything, then receeded as summer came again.  We were all in the small exploratory boat of the narrator.  We heard the noise of a large boat and realized one was coming and the narrator and two other crew members were still out in the water.    On the boat -- the narrator swimming back with the paralyzed boy, who could move again,and the child with mental retardation,  THe cold water getting to them -- first to the child with retardation, whose face contorted hirribly, his tongue coming out thick and swollen, what looked like a button popping off it.  Then the same thing began happening to the man.  Then the external hallucinations began -- first an ocotpus appeared out of the water, but a cartoon one -- then a giant inflatable seal with tentacles, also inflatable, loomed above them.  It was unclear if they would ever make it to the boat. 
2642 20060628090607 Everyone else was going down to the seaside where giant waves were crashing but I decided to move my towel and books and table just a little more out of the way, since when I looked the waves were gathering in force and coming closer and closer.  We had set up our items beneath a metal structure, some sort of pavilion.  When I looked the sea was rushing towards me in giant waves.  Towards all of us really, but I was no longer sure where my companions were -- just was thinking of moving myself and some big table (kind of like the one Kate had gotten from Ginny's house) out of the path of the water.  This is no ordinary high tide, but some sort of storm surge.  Because the closed back of the pavilion is only about thirty feet away, I realize there is nowhere for me to go but up.  The sea water is swirling around below me and I am trying to scramble up the walls.  Suddenly I am seemingly small, grasping on to the tiniest of vent holesnear the top of the wall.  THe water is rising beneath me. With a screwdriver I am trying to pry off the grate just enough that I can crawl inside or at least get my finger in.  There are patrolmen on ground trying to prevent me from escaping the water in this way.  I must hide my screwdriver from them and act almost as though I were just washed up there.  There are spiders and cobwebs inthe vents.    Later the seas have calmed and I am driving my car back along Shore Road.  I see many cars trying to cross Mount Sinai harbor with various degrees of stuckness.  Then I too am driving through the water, nearby to wear the boat ramp is; the car is just floating across the surface, not really touching any ground.  I just need to get it a little further. On the other side,when it touched land, it turns into awheelbarrow.  An old man gives me encouragement as I push it up the hill.  t the top of the hill I see Sean Keane in a red cuorduroy jacket and funny pants and tie and long, high-school-era hair.  He is on a skateboard talking on his cell phone.  "Sean!"  I say.  "Come ride in a wheelbarrow!" He does not hear or see me at first but I finally convince him.  Late on city streets, the other side of the tracks in Harlingen perhaps, or some other small south- or mid-western city, I see Matthew Fernow also riding some sort of scooter, carrying along his sister's kid, who I haven't seen since ten years ago when she was three.  Now she is only about five but almost tyrannical.  I see Linda Vanella and others at their wooded suburban home.  Everyone is upset because local Republican officials were trying to rig an election by giving extra votes to Hispanic people. 
2672 20030525125007 the nichomachean ethics   I'm driving wih my dad out Highway 431.  We're off to the woods to glimpse some astronomical event.  It's still daylight, though, the sun a pale pink glow in the sky straining to become gold.  There's been a big storm, or so we gather: there's water everywhere, and in the streets dogs are roaming--dazed, we think, after being struck by lightning.  A beautiful and faithful looking cocker spaniel is at the crossroads of Hillsboro Road and Old Hickory, wandering through the median, lost and crazed.    We'd passed a mangy dog, earlier, wandering in much the same way, but I realize suddenly that the dog we see now is filled with excellence and virtue, even in its addled state.  It has been struck by "low-lying lightning" and is trying to get back home.  I feel great compassion for it, and yet we are speeding on.  The dog, filled with the virtue of a faithful dog, continues to weave and wander down the median of Old Hickory.   My dad and I are driving down a dirt road, past overgrown farm fields, woods and scrub brush.  At the corner when we first get on the dirt road  there's a ramshackle falling down three story barn, greyed by time and weather.  Outside in the rocky dirt yard three enormous burros are tethered to a pole.  They have elongated necks, small heads, and expressive eyes, somewhat like emus.  They are standing together, each in a diferent orientation, swaying and weaving.  I realize that their appearance--teh singed and downy look of their fur, their wide-open eyes, their tremors--are the result of them having been struck by lightning.  "There's been a storm here, definitely," I tell my dad.  In the distance, a few hundred yards up, I spot a thin plume of smoke rising from behind the treeline.    "Look!" I say.  But as we drive by, I realize it's an enormous irrigation sprinkler, watering a field that's a combination of potatoes and orange groves.  It's turning in jerks, segmenting the world into stop-motion snapshots, framed by the white stream of a spray of water.  We've gotten out of the car or it has fallen away from us.  We're walking up a path in the woods.  My dad spots a snake that I do not see. "Look," he says.  "The second snake I've found in Tennessee."  He bends down to the leaf-covered floor of the trail and picks it up.  It is long--almost two feet--and shiny black, all the way around.  It's not the sort of snake I'm familiar with.  My dad is holding its jaw, coaxing out its tongue.  It's somehow a way to calm it and identify it.  I realize we've driven past the storm--that is, it's headed east now, past us, and we'll be able to see whatever it is we came to see. 
2676 20060104090208 In this movie or story the man in the kitchen is warned that he will receive a visitor, and indeed he does, a la Mozart's Requiem, an unshaven man, beard one day-old, in a hooded jacket that obscures his face.    "I would be careful what checks you write out of Satan's checkbook," the visitor says, and suddenly the man he is visiting remembers when he had been told that he would have a visitor that said the same thing.  He looks and finally sees the spirit (evil, I believe) of a woman with long brown hair keening over the kitchen sink, following him wherever he goes.  It is unclear at this point whether or not these are hallucinations brought on by alcohol.  The woman is sprinkling something in each drawer of his kitchen.  When he notices her finally he comes over to her in anger but then is overtaken by desire.  She is holding a large butterknife to her throat but when he sees her she moves it behind her mouth and on its end materializes a piece of meat.  She is putting the piece of meat to her mouth and the man says, "Mmm ... give me a piece of that ... salt."  Furious, the woman disappears, the devil inside her driven away by the mention of salt.  Outside we were assembling the precursors to the people that would serve in a great battle / play.  The people have some look of what they will look like later (in the hereafter?) but some are in the forms of miniature horses, Shetland ponies, boars with curving tusks.  The tornado that came, and the concrete board in the basement that would rise up in hurricane strength winds.  How I would have to move it, heavy as it was.  This scene before the animals.  The old man book of mystery.  Refound.  The pictures pasted on the pages were folded over, repasted and ruined by time and water.  The mass.  The nuns in novice habit, but there was a different word for it.  Yvette Valdez was a nun but she was taller and blonde.  Standing outside with the animals to be selected for the battle, all rushing towards us but we were not afraid, knowing all to be on some level an illusion of what was really there.  When the handsome young man and his father approached I said my name with a Spanish accent and Yvette, annoyed, used the same accent to say her name was "Olivetta".  Later the mass foreshortened because it was taking too much time.  The mother superior of the Unitarian church deliveringthe homily stepping down, disappointed and unsurprised.  I was glad and sad.  Glad because it was so long.  Sad because they were in the process of starting something new, a truer reflection of faith, but sad too because it did not seem possible in the nun's outfits and ritual format of the old. 
2679 20030629221208 dream of 6/27 Returning to the house with Joe Hardwick, photographer.  The girl from Montana, broad shouldered and dark-haired, was walking around with her shirt off.  She had strong arms like a volleyball or basketball player, and she was tan all over.  "It's freezing in Montana, but we're used to it--we walk around with our shirts off all the time.  On the ski slopes, the sun is blazing.  You can get a tan in minutes, and a bad burn in not much longer."  Outside on the median of a bizarre residential street where all the trees looked like they were made of shiny rubber and plastic, a cat on a leash was running in a frenzy.  The leash had a large stuffed animal on the other side of it, and the cat was trying to get free of it--it didn't understand why the stuffed animal kept chasing after it.  I met up with Karl Schantz, now living in La Julia; he checked to see that I still knew how to spell his last name.  I walked to the large charter house, now transformed into a museum, to mail my package.  A classroom with Camie and others inside of it, paying one another and collecting money for their handicrafts, sold earlier that day at a craft fair.  dream of 6/28  A tiny orange bonnet with a tiny paler orange head beneath it, like a  netsuke .  Making enchiladas the old fashioned way: "No one does that anymore," someone tells me.  dream of 6/29  In my white tank top and white shorts, in the unlit cavernous room. Tony T. and another former student, who I also refer to as Tony but later recognize as another child, have come in.  Tony T. is making fun of my outfit but I feel self-conscious, as well, because it is thin and short and innapropriate for me to wear in front of my students.  I send them away, Tony with his husky voice that sounds always like he has a cold or hasn't slept.  I realize only later that they've probably shown up because they are hungry and there is no food in their houses.  I realize after they've gone away, too, that we have tutoring this morning.  It's the first day back to school after a long vacation.  The students are sitting at small tables in my room and I'm scrambling to find books for them to read.  The dwarf child, captured on film smoking the ganja, firing a gun.  How quickly he slipped into this role, walking down the cobblestone streets of his city, lit by the indirect rays of the early morning sun: with a single suggestion from the tall man at his side.    My Nanny uttering these words to me, which I struggle to remember and understand: "What's four drops of blood on two sheets that will soon enough be slipped around you in the cold hard ground.  You're a slave to fate; forget about it." 
2702 20040702233407 Dreamt I was in el Valley for a weekend trip -- but when I went into Landrum for a visit, they needed a speech therapist, so I wound up doing that for a day.  I didn't know what to do with the two little kids I'd had to take out of their classroom for help correctly pronouncing dipthongs, though.  My breath smelled horrible, I realized.  We were walking down the old specials hallway of my elementary school -- where we had gone for music and art class and, later on, band lessons.  The old room where witchy Ms. Gobetz had stood in the doorway with her frizzy grey-blond hair and long long fingernails, beckoning us into art calss, had been painted over, and the strange converted storage room where we used to go for woodwind lessons with Mr. Sorrentino was a bathroom now, it seemed, or an office. There was a new door leading into the classroom that used to be the art room, and it was there that I sat down with the young kids and told them about how I used to have to go to speech class too, which is true: I went because I substituted a "th" or a "d" instead of an "s" at the beginning of words that started with "s", and that's what I told them.  My old mentor teacher Mr. Canas came in with his class and was surprised and happy to see me.  He came over to give me a hug -- he had grown to be eight feet tall but was otherwise unchanged.    The children returned to their classroom and I stepped behind a counter to what I realized was the main office.  The classroom had made me sad: there was a nubbly carpet on the floor in the 70s shade of green peculiarly  called avocado, and wood paneling on the walls; everything in the room looked pre-fabricated out of monotony and resistance to sunlight and change.   Behind the counter of the main office I was surprised to find my name on a cubby among the teachers' mailboxes.  Inside were several assessment reports on children who had been evaluated for the special education program.  I was worried that I had received these, as I was only in town for a weekend and hadn't been at the school for two years.  I checked the ARD calendar: I was supposed to lead two special education meetings the following weekend.  How would I do it, I wondered -- I'd have to fly back down.  I suddenly realized that I had to go -- it was time for me to fly home already.  I hadn't even had time to say hello to my friend Debbie Staple.  Should I leave her a note? I wondered -- or should I just stop by the classroom where she was an aide?  I didn't really have time for either, and she would be real mad if I left town without saying hi.  Then, in real life, I woke up with a start.  It was 9:46 a.m., and I had to be at work in 10 minutes. 
2718 20060509082608 The video performance of the man and his younger selves.  "Time Lapse Youth to Age" or something was the title.  We looked at black and white photos at first, taken at very varied stages of life (two as a small child, one as a full grown man) superimposed one after the other. Slowly I realized that the man moved through a sequence of poses -- laying down to sitting up to standing to laying down again, corresponding to the static position of each photo.  But the images were no longer still photos, but rather the man moving through the positions in a repetitive dance.  I thought of rituals of birth and death and rebirth as the man lay down and then got up again; that is, I thought about how cultures represent these processes.  The man's face was changing and now we no longer saw the soft and unwrinkled face of youth but his older, sterner face.  Now that face too got older and older but the unceasing movement continued.  Then the man's motions got smaller and you could see that he was continuing these motions but in a box. There was a dog beside him now, a german shepherd.  He gave the dog one last reassuring pat.  Then from above his son, another incarnation of his younger self, began throwing dirt over what we relaized was his grave.  The man's motions stopped but he was not completely still, just resting his hand on the dog, who was trembling, as earth fell on them and the light grew darker and darker.  Then one saw the top of the grave and the shiny black shoes of the son jumping up and down on it to firm it up.  The giant mechanized cross appeared, gothic and multi-parted, half in the grave and half out.  Trying to hang with Karen Kinslow.  She had given Erin Hidalgo (nee Wilder) a "nose job", but by Karen's own account it was "really unsuccessful".  Wagner's opera playing very loudly outside the bar-like area where I was gathering materials and eavesdropping on other's conversations, wishing I was part of them.  In the hallway kitchen, I was heating something on the gas stove when I realized that a synthetic sweatshirt was sitting on one of the lit bruners.  I grabbed it off with a potholder, but it had already melted onto the burner, and when I pulled hard to get it off, the red-hot element of the burner, more like an electric stove than a gas range, cam with it.  Flammable gas was leaking out of the element, and large flames were already billowing up from where the sweatshirt was burning. I was shouting for someone to come in  with a fire extinguisher.  I didn't want to run to get one for fear the flames would spread.  The towering flame on teh stove was about to reach the gas leak.  Rick came in with a fire extinguisher and together we got it out. 
2722 20030803023207 dream of 7/31   I dreamt the clippings that I took from the dying euonymus at my parents' house would come to life again if I planted them in sand.    On the side of the brick building, a whole bus length long, a sleek painted greyhound indicating where to queue for the bus.  Remembering with my mom the two fish markets we used to go to when my sisters and I were just wee tykes.  "Pacienza," the two old Italian men at the first fish shop would always say to each other.  "Patience."  My dad had purchased the new Fountains of Wayne album.  Shards of discarded broken pottery, glazed in delicate blues and greens, scattered by the grove of bamboo by the side of my parents' house.  As I descended the stairs, talking on the phone, I glimpsed the plastic placards, a step-by-step spiritual trail featuring exercises for physical, emotional and spiritual development, each accompanied by a handy icon.  My friend Danielle's funny garbage bag full of empty cleaning supply bottles.   dream of 8/1   I dreamt a house: a lady's daughter and a dog, running around under tables and by a cash register.  The girl, about four or five, constantly asked or forced by her mom to do math puzzles, mostly spatial manipulations.  The young girl was very adept but so young that her mind went elsewhere easily: she wanted to be young and play but her mom kept forcing her to do these puzzles.  In the same house, a combination store/restaurant/living quaters, I saw an exhibit comparing Tao Te Ching/Buddhist writings with Christian texts, stating the parallels and claiming firmly which were true and which were false.  My Aunt Doreen and Uncle Joe had come to visit.  They were getting back in the car--an enormous SUV--with the help of unfamiliar man.  There were two rows of back seats, but room only in the very last one for my cousin Caitlin.    The Music Row traffic circle had been built up like NY's revamped 42nd Street.  Suddenly my friend Corie appeared on the far corner.  She had come to visit after all.  She spotted a person she knew among the hundreds milling about.  As Corie and I walked, Will was sending me an e-mail to let me know that his semester would be a washout--but that although he wouldn't have classes because of the bumblings of his college's absentee president, he also wouldn't have to pay tuition, and he'd have plenty of time to write poetry and make broadsides with me.  Corie looked at all my books, old collectible children's pop-ups and fold-out games--including Uncle Wiggly and a racist scratch and sniff by Madame Alexander, famed doll designer.  Bryce's posters, many more than I actually have, badly stored in the corner among hundreds of my lino cuts, all in my old room.  
2724 20030328090007 My sister Sarah and I had been running together.  She lost a pair of big mustard yellow hoop earrings that I had owned in sixth grade.  The backs had fallen out somewhere along a new road that had been put in along our across-the-street-neighbors' property by my parents' home.    In a fast food restaurant soemwhere, a large group of us were hanging out.  For some reason I had a map of the universe, and I was trying to plot where our earth's sun fit in.   Brandon  saw a problem with where I had put the sun (I called it the sol, actually).  He made a suggestion of some alternate angles that I could consider and then, within a matter of seconds, produced an amazingly detailed constellation map of all the stars in the Western hemisphere.  All the stars were grouped in constellations with Latin names and forms drawn from  Ovid's Metamorphoses .  I could not understand how Brandon had drawn his map so quickly, but I felt like it had something to do with studying Latin in high shcool.  My sisters Sarah and Kate were returning, with me, to the spot where Sarah had lost her earrings.  Sarah and I were trying to run fast enough that Kate would give up and stop running with us--but I had not been running in a while, and I quickly lost my motivation to run up this hill.  There was a large outbuilding of our neighbors' that we kept trying to explore; it was half-complete, dilapidated, filled with dead-end rooms.  Its ceiling was the sky.    My Nanny and a bunch of her friends were over my parents' house. They kept badmouthing another friend of theirs who they were now shunning.   "They'll be no one at her third marriage, to be sure," my Nanny said to her friend Jeanie.    "Yes, she's distanced herself from all her friends, certainly," Jeanie said in her singsong voice.    "I wonder when my daughter is going to set out the dessert," muttered my Nanny, looking around at the room, crowded with people.  "Where's the dessert, Alesandra?" my Nanny asked me.  "I'll get it, Nanny," I said.  I crept past my seated Nanny and her friend, crawling along a ledge they sat against.  I pulled out old-fashioned Italian pastries and rainbow-sprinkled cookies from the friddge, serving platters and knives from the cabinets.  There were cakes on the table already without anything to hold them.  I set them out on the coffee table. All my uncles and my dad were giving me advice on how to arrange the desserts.  Much, much later, I was being forced to marry an old, old man. There was music I had to always play or sing when I was around him:  continuous sets of slurred eighth notes in six-eight time.  It sounded like English folk music; it was something, I thought, from the  Brook Green Suite .     
2730 20030313080807 Fire Safety   Just before I woke at 3:30 am, I saw two large beetles--a giant black scarab and a scavenger beetle with large pincer-horns--scamper across a wooden floor.  I was surprised when my feet touched carpet when I got up.  Somebody was styling my hair but they were styling it quite nastily. They had a curling iron and were trying to curl some bangs that they had cut just above my forehead.  They were curling them to the side of my head, though, so I looked like I had a toupee.  When I examined my hair more closely, I saw that I had many white hairs.  We were in a house unlike any house I've ever been in, standing in a large and largely unfurnished second floor room. There was a gas range tucked in the farthest corner of the room, just by two large windows.  I was trying to light the burners on the gas stove.  Several hazardous things happened.  Small bits of paper got trapped on one of the burners, which was actually more like a wide-based hurricane lamp; I had to try to blow these small fires out before they spread and merged.  One of the burners' adjustment knobs got pushed in, so that the burner was letting off gas but unable to light.  We knew that it was pooling up in the stove and would soon increase enough in volume and pressure that it would basically explode.   Plus, gas was seeping out already; in my dream, we acted as though it were carbon monoxide or chlorine gas.  We needed to get out before it affected us--but I wanted to try to fix the right rear burner.  I tried pulling it out with the shoddy old pair of green-handled tongs from my parents' house (the knob was red hot and you couldn't touch it directly), but I only succeeded in pulling out the knob for the right front burner, which promptly glowed red and burst into flames.  "We have to get out of here," my mom kept saying.  I thought of all the things in the house that I would lose now--because the flames would surely ignite the gas and the whole building would go up in flames.  My journal--I may or may not have grabbed that.  There was a book that wound up outside--a yoga guide--that I was happy to see.   Suddenly I knew I had to try to go back inside and shut off the burner, to prevent any further damage.  By this time the poison gas would be thick.  My mom, suddenly pregnant, offered to go.   "You can't go in your condition," I told her. "Think of your baby."  But she insisted on coming with me.  We went into the upstairs kitchen and I used the tongs again to shut off the right front burner. By this time the gas had really affected my mom--she didn't even want to leave the poison filled room.  I had to almost carry her outside, and even the fresh air there didn't immediately revive her.   
2758 20030603144407 All the way back from South Texas I slept--fantastic, disjointed dreams, punctuated by clouds and mist and the occasional rearrangement of my elbows on the middle armrests.  Impossible animals and visitations.  Mountains and improbable treks and implausible messages.  But just now I slept again, a fitful yet deep sleep only half-an-hour long.  Five minutes in I woke up thinking I'd been asleep all day, or for multiple days in a row, kicking off blankets and tossing and turning in my fight with sleep.  I felt like I did once when I slept for three days straight: like I was battling sleep, like I was running a marathon through it or swimming against its heavy current.  I was going to conquer sleep by beating it at its own game.   I woke up exhausted.  But I dreamt a fantastic journal.  I had found all my old journals; they were in the upstairs room of my parents' house that was not their house, that was on a beach somewhere up north, open to the sand and salt and the wind and water.  My old journals had funny cut-outs of Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet, old school A.A. Milne-style, cut out from beautiful hand-drawn and colored wallpaper.  I'd affixed them to my journals at some point, and I'd started putting on Peter Rabbit on another one, but the adhesive was old and was falling off.    Then I remembered something I wanted to put in my current journal.  I opened it up, looking for a blank page.  I passed page after page of sketches inspired, I thought, by an exhibit I'd seen recently at a museum.  The backgrounds had been painted in brightly colored watercolor washes, rainbow-sherbert style, but glowing as though living or burning.    Over all that I'd sketched, much more vibrantly than I do in real life, bold scenes of people: eating, sleeping, carousing, in vast medieval castles.  The pictures were predominately black, but I'd left bold patches of the watercolor background to indicate light streaming in thick castle walls, falling across torsos and limbs, moulding each body.  The sketches were good, the sort of sketch I aspire to--bold yet fluid lines, supple as ink but weighty as an object carved in stone or printed in one-color block.  The edges were spidery, full of light and dark and shadow--the best qualities of etching and pen and ink rolled in one.  And the figures, too, combined block prints and charcoal--they were fluid and yet solid.  My mom was looking and she liked them too.  I discounted her opinion at first.  I thought I had just copied them from something I had seen.  I turned page after page.  Suddenly I realized they were all my own ideas.  When I woke up, for a few minutes I couldn't understand why, as I thumbed through my sketchbook, I couldn't find my pages of rainbow sketches. 
2763 20030307091808 "Send your swift messenger upon my right hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to you of all birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as I go forth to the ships of the Danaans."   Ants were everywhere.  I didn't realize it at first, but someone had left two sugar-syrup exuding prints drying on the counter in the arts and crafts room.  These were a new breed of super ants; instead of sending out scouts to explore a territory, cut a trail to something of interest, and then report back to the ant camp, these ants moved out en masse, using their super sense of smell to determine the best direction in which to travel.  They were like an army of myrmidons.  I lifted up the piece of cloth which they were walking across to try to divert them but I could not.  Later I was walking along a road that looked like it was in South Texas; in the distance I could see a red-headed woman walking past a resaca.  Her expression changed to one of disgust as she walked past it; I saw her wrinkle her nose and her brow and start running past it.  She had on one dress shoe and one marroon soft brace, as though she had injured her left foot.  I knew she was running from something awful she'd seen by the resaca, but I didn't get a chance to ask her what--besides, I knew I would investigate it myself.   As I walked closer--I was about fifty feet away--I could hear the whirrring and whizzing of birds--kind of like the noise starlings make s they roost in trees in great flocks for the night.  Here, though, I could see hundreds of crows, jackdaws, geese, ducks, jays and wrens, a huge (two foot tall) raven and most bizarrely, in the broad bright South Texas sunshine, a great horned owl.  Many of these birds were swarming around some kill that had been made.  I saw just the tip of the kill and for a second feared that it was a person they were pecking at. The birds shifted for a second and I saw that it was a pair of mallards, a male and a female, all torn apart and bloody.    "Why are geese and wrens and jays eating this?" I thought.  Something had gone wrong; ravens and crows I could understand, but these other birds were acting agaist nature.  The owl in daylight, too,  cavorting with crows and ravens--this puzzled and worried me too.  "What new alliances exist int he bird world," I thought, that crows and raven will befriend, rahter than mob, an owl in broad daylight?"  Muh later, with much ceremony, my neighbor chuck gave me a placard that made me cry--I do not rememebr all of it, but it was a public school teacher and union supporter's quote, and it was basiclaly something cheesy about being true to yourself: "And each one must find and navigate by his own pacific meridian," it read, in part.   
2763 20060404090008 Gaspar the sweet dog-headed cartoon character.  In the beginning of the mini movie a shot of the whole town awash in carnival lights, amusement park rides, flags and tents and banners.  The state fair had returned, thanks to Gaspar's efforts, to how he remembered it in the days of his youth in _____, Montana. There he was with the body of a skinny man and the beautiful puppet-like head of a toy pretty dog -- proportioned so that, like a toy dog, it is almost too large for the rest of his body.  He still, the cartoon voiceover tells us, "gives rides to visitors to town on his trusty bicycle, pointing out sites and reciting love poetry."  But gales and winter storms have grown fiercer these years, especially for an 84 year-old, and so several years ago (the camera pans away to show Gaspar pedalling his bike along a railroad track) the city transformed a set of tracks so that Gaspar's bike rides along them.  When I saw the little children, waiting in the van for their mom, who had to answer informal defense questions for her thesis on the relationships between Dominican, Chinese, and Southeast Asian cultures, I wanted to help keep them entertained so that they did not distract her or get bored.  So I asked permission from their mom tohave them follow me and I let them know that we would do a science experimen together.  For some reason I asked permission from the policeofficer standing guard in front of one of the buildings on the large open stone courtyard we were now within, as well.  The "experiment" was not really an experiment at all, just us seeing if we could get one of the lenses from my glasses to serve as a magnifying glass in order to start a fire.  The sun kept going in and out of clouds so it was hard to focus its rays -- only thin plumes of smoke would emerge intermittnetly.  But when we finally put a piece of treated wood beneath it it almost instantly buckled and bubbled.  The kids were impressed, and so was I, but I was frightened by the power of the glasses and the sun, as well.  Later walking through the campus and the large medical school building with my mom and dad, we tried getting out to the "NPR Observation Deck" -- the area outside of the nurses' library with the beautiful view. When we finally got to the info desk to ask -- in the opulent, baroque style cental hall -- it turned out that the very friendly woman with the limited English vocabulary could not get intouch with the elevator operators who would have to let us up.  We'd have to come back another time: $15 for either 15 or 50 minutes, I couldn't make it out.  I thanked her profusely as we left; she was truly very nice.  Cat's Blues in my head when I woke up and me singing "if i could have a clue what justice is ..."  
2787 20060122110607 We were driving an RV around and our drivers (there were two, my sister Kate and a friend of our other sister's) had stopped the van somewhere on the street in Woodbury, LI, just underneath a large dark overpass. Suddenly the line of cars behind us pulled back and a metal wall like the ones used to lock up storefronts in cities descended down directly behind us.  Another came down in front of us and it was then I realized we were paused right on the train tracks.  "Oh shit," I said.  I thought for a second about grabbing my stuff out of the car (every material thing I might consider valuable was in there), but instead I just shouted, "Get out, guys, and stand back." Then I ran beneath the gateclosing in front of me, crossing over expanses of track, to the train depot where Kate and the other girl were buying tickets.  I was running and running, trying to guage at the same time when the train would arrive. I got to the door of the depot and shouted inside, "The train!  The car on the tracks!"  I thought I could see Kate on the line, far away and unable to hear me.  But then she emerged again, running, outside, with the other lady, who sprinted off ahead in one direction to see if she could get there faster.  Kate and I went a different way.  Here it was dark and shadowy under the overpass.  We passed one woman in a Rusain-style mini-tank that had been modified to serve as a railroad repair/observation vehicle.  She urged us to hurry (she was in communication with the train engineers, who were doing their best to slow the train).  Kate hopped the third rail, but I stood before it watching its ribbon of electricity, unsure whether it was safe to jump. Another worker came over in one of those three rubber-wheeled security guard carts and parked his tire on the rail.  "Hop over," he said, "it's fine."  I ran to the RV.  Everyone was cheering and the lady we had seen inthe mini-tank was saying into her walkie-talkie, "I'm gonna bust you guys the next time I sees ya," which was because the train had actually switched over to another track and had never actually posed a threat to the RV.  In the distance we could see it far off at the switching yard, in sunshine.  We got back in the RV and drove downthe rail ourselves. We hit some car, a teal and white Pontiac (?) which was placed on the tracks as part of an experiment about what would happen to various vehicles if left on the tracks.  In a strange coincidence, it had been Kate and her friend Molly's car many years ago, when they were still in high school.  They had lied to Molly's dad in order to be able to detail itthemseleves, and then lied again when it was damaged in a wreck.  It had passed underneath the RV onthe tracks, almost unscathed except for a few rubbed paint marks. 
2813 20060725111608 i drove the car or walked down mount sinai coram road to where it ended against shore road west.  as i turned meghan kramer drove by.  i saw the sharp profile of her nose.  sarah was talking with my mom.  "steve guzzetta?" someone said and someone corrected them.  "you mean steve giffen?"  both sarah and kate and their friend were trying to talk on their cell phones.  they were working despite us being deep in a valley. but really they would only work from one particular spot on the opposite side of the road from edna and steve's.  the woods were brown and leaves were on the ground.  they pointed out the one spot where cell phones got reception and i imagined for a second that the reason they worked is because someone had installed a private cell phone tower.  "listen," kate said.  someone was reading off in alphabetical order strange place names and old first names.  "aphra, behn, camden ..."  it was a tiny numbers station in the woods underground sending out messages for spies.   "it's like yankee hotel foxtrot," i said.  "yankee - hotel - foxtrot", i said again, saying the words like the lady in "poor places".  ryan becker was visiting and we were eating old easter candy in the den while looking at childhood photos of my sister and me.  he began to eat a chocolate truck that looked like a christmas gift to my mother and i was a little worried because i didn't think she would want her present eaten, not because she wanted to eat it but because it was hers.  chuck's relative or friend was getting married in his home.  there were strains of beautiful music and we saw the quartet walking around the house warming up and doing mic check.  the roof of the hosue was high and filled with light as though it was a great hall with a fireplace int eh center of it.  the musicians came outside they were young and i was embarassed by how good they were compared to me.  one of them intorduced herself and said that they were available for many gigs during the school year and outside it.  they had a coach or manager, a heavy-set woman in pastel print shirt and pastel lemon pants.  i felt like i should know her; her face seemed familiar.  she looked at me as though she knew me somewhat froma  previous disastrous performance.  the girl who was palying flute was trying to sing "i will always love you" but her timing was off and her voice too booming.  the violist or violinist next to me stepped in and everyone said for her to sing it.  then it was time for them to play so they scrambled off the low platform stage where thy were assembled and went inside to play.  we were there and sitting among the crowd for the cereony so i decided we should stay.  a photograph of mike wells and a lady his age, but taken when we were all much younger, proof of the value of adoption 
2826 20060920091607 An evil force, forces really, dwelled at the top of the four story house.  They were supposed to stay up there out of deference to a long-tradition of right-of-way, but recently they had started encroaching into the normal world.  The signs were numerous and spooky: A forlorn wooden child's chair that moved by itself.  Storms that came out of nowhere and pushed dead leaves into spiralling towers.  Spirits that entered a room and took you elsewhere.  A van that drove itself (but when we looked closely we saw there was a woman on the underside of the carriage -- she was trying to take spy pictures of us with her camera in order to steal our soul).  We drove into Donna, actually the edge of Harlingen just near the arroyo, to regroup and discuss our plan. Their big attack would happen tonight.  On the resaca I saw again flat-bottomed boats with their hulls of concrete.  olly and I drove over one bridge, then turned to find another, with an evil spirit in fast pursuit.  At night in the third floor of the house we got ready for the final showdown. My dad put on a pink and black wig which was tainted by the spirits but luckily it didn't affect him.  I knew the spirits were coming and so I bundled my sisters into my mom and dad's room, which was the den of my parents' house.  I stayed on the edge of the room looking out into the kitchen, watching the guaze curtain that separated the room billow in unnatural air.  Under the big tent the announcer's voice drew our attention to the open doors at the top of the tent. At the bottom of a stairway we couldn't see, hundreds of trained baboons waited for the signal.  When it was given they would climb the stairs and sit among us as friends.  "The baboons' normally silken fur is given a silver sheen by the daily application of volcanic dust and ash," the announcer said.  The baboons ome of the baboons would pose together.  They had climbed each as far as they were supposed to and now the signal was given to descend.  They would be replaced by bonobos, bunnies, other animals who would climb and hop their way to the top.  Some people did not want to give the baboons up.  I climbed down the steps of the big top.  THere was a special stairway reserved for the rabbits so they wouldn't get crushed but people were walking in it, so only one big chocolate lop-eared climbed up it.  The bulk of the animals waited with their trainers beyond the circus tent doors.  Earlier, last night: from the tracks where the goddess walked after she had been killed, three seedlings sprouted in each footprint from three drops of blood.  The corn, beans and squash grew and deep in a bamboo forest people made trellises for shelters and gardens, until mauraders came and set fire to all the wood and the whole forest was aflame.  A wild boar and a dog fought. 
2827 20030723004207 18 july  The child (later identified as Kelvin and Pam's son) wandering through the busy three lane road--rapidly crossing back and forth between lanes--later reaching the sidewalk and helping Tony Trejo hang homemade signs for an auto expo--  Bryce's shop, redone on a cliff face.  An urgent meeting, but I on my way to it was sneaking food from Bryce's pantry.  19 july  Sean the Rimboy's comment in the darkened room: "That's gotta hurt."  20 july  The old rambling house with the wooden access ramp, elevated over swampland.  Here my father told me how, in childhood, his mother had asked him to name the gigantic oaken dining table and he, after thinking for a minute, had said, "Table Salt"..  All his family laughed and laughed.    Laura Sobik was in the high school marching band.  She was the only one in a skirt.  She was trying to talk to me as they marched into the back room of the barn, backlit by the firelight coming out of the side room. Andrea Songhen was playing bass clarinet, and the band was marching  in formation, forming and reforming shapes.  Elephant tusks, gigantic and bound at the bottom with a golden clasp. They were hidden in the woods, and we hunted for them.  Then I found them and had to hide them again.  I wanted to separate them but I could not so I had to hide them together.  21 july  A frog getting ready for a Mothers Day celebration.  The cartoon on the front of the card with the picture of an Asian boy listening to a couple talking in front of the refrigerator.  "We're putting Mama in a home," a man said.  In the next panel the small boy was hugging an older woman in front of an oven.  "Waaaah!" or "Heyyy!", I cannot remember which, read the speech bubble above his head.  22 july  Laura Sobik had arranged with me that I would cheat on my Social Studies Regents exam.  I didn't want to, but I didn't say yes or no either way, and I didn't tell anyone else.  I stayed home the day of the exam, though I knew there would be no way to make it up.  Yet Laura completed my test anyway, and somehow my signature was affixed to it.  A police officer came to the hotel room where I was staying to arrest me.  I had enormous styes in my eye.  Earlier in the same hotelcomplex a grad student in the theology/religion department lay with her husband, an ancient Greek, beneath the theater style curtains of their bed.  She kept trying to decide what she was going to do with her life; she had listed about five possibilities. Ultimately she settled on one.  "I'm going to be a counselor," she told her husband as they got into the bed.  "Oh," said the husband.  "How good."  Then he took a large wooden post and beat her on the head until she died.  In the broad sunlight, glistening like upstate summer, an enormous raven was flying at my eyes, trying to peck them out. 
2830 20061128003610 the faithful tiger tried to enter the house but it and the other big cat were not allowed in.  outside i sent it and i sat down beside it and began to pet it, in the backyard by the side of the garage.  kate came over to ask me for a natty light from my red bag, but when we opened the malibu there were none left, so she had to take a normal budweiser in an old old can from the sixties instead.  we looked and tried to trace where ceci had driven and the temperature there, the interstates that ran through.  as the swift winter day gathered up and dusk began descending i walked down marble steps of an elaborate living room.  but when i reached the wall there was no wall and i was outside with the steps continuing to a lake or the boundaries of the sea.  the sea pulsed with slower and slower life as the temperature dropped and its waves froze slowly, in motion.  i picked up our things stored at the edge of the water but i let two bundles go accidentally.  one was a manila folder full of stuff, what was it, i dind't knopw. another were some of my supplies, for felting more than anything.  perhaps i would be able to go by the real shore of the freezing water,at the bottom of the stairs, and get back our things from the heart-like sea.  we were cleaning the masoleum house of marble.  it was our workshop and we had let it get most untidy.  i picked up big plastic bags that my sisters had been supposed to tidy.  and yesterday: the culvert with the water running through it, water i was not afraid to enter though it was dark and slimy in there.  there generation after generation of school children had explored, each of them writing their names in a different section of pipe according to grade.  and later today: at the camp ringed on all sides by water, the same water on one side that had been frozen and fierce, but i went to the other side where a stream ran.  amy weidner was there, and ali nagel from high school.  when i walked out to them where they sat on rocks i kept losing my balance and sticking first my foot in the water, then my whole backside as i completely lost balance and fell int he water.  a man pulled a kayak into the underbrush, the narrow offshoot of the river.  i spilled a soda bottle and tried in vain to calculate how fast it was oving.  a goose followed after, not even paddling, just being moved by the current.  earlier i had been in the shower at my parents but it was really a shower at finer things.  and after that out at the camp i wa walking along various cabins from the forties, walking on a dead tree trunk almost four feet across, trying not to overtly stare at the couple next to me despite my personal interest, looking for mushrooms on the trunk of the tree, in the window of the cabin there were strange atomizers, bottles of perfume and cheap beer.

2834 20030301120207 Go East, Young Woman   A group of people around my age--but perhaps we were younger, more high  school age than anything--was standing around in a set of trailers in an  open field in upstate New York.  One of the trailers was actually a school bus that had been turned into a permanent and parked classroom/ meeting area.  The day was sunny and warm like a late May summer's day.   People were coming in and out of the trailers and I was trying to be  friendly but no one was really my friend; everyone had their own group  of acquaintances.  I had to drive from upstate New York down through Tennessee and across  the US to all of the Southwestern states, making sure to pass through  Colorado, and end up eventually in Wyoming.  Then I would have to drive  back.  I had about five days and a strange and unreliable map that  showed my journey moving from west to east--that is, my final  destination, Wyoming, was somewhere to the east on my map.  The map kept  trying to display the shortest route to various destinations--but that  shortest route led me through treacherous mountains in Colorado and New  Mexico before dumping me in a desolate stretch of Wyoming (as if that  would be dificult to do).  The skies above upstate New York had turned slate grey and it looked like it was about to snow.  There was a strange superimposed image of Minnesota in the Southwest  corner of the map, printed just next to a state along the coast called  Eoyeweh.  I had to consult another map to confirm my belief that  Minnesota was not, indeed, in the Southwest but rather up along the  Canadian border.  Looking back at my faulty map I saw that someone had  attributed the image to Rick's friend Allen; he'd seen it himself in a  vision, Minnesota in the same position on the map next to the imaginary state.  The handwritten notes int he margin said, "Proof of the first  proof by Allen Ballman."  I was looking at the map as I rode in a somewhat cramped back seat of a  car.  A baby was in a car seat in the backseat, too; the baby was  spinning around and sliding out of her car seat.  Now I was in my Nanny's old house frantically trying to pack up all my  suitcases--I had to leave to board a plane in only twenty minutes, and I  had several large and completely disheveled bags.  I took a quick peek  in Gin's old closet--the one which had another door inside it that led  to a stairway to the attic.  I walked into the closet and teh door shut  tight behind me--it was spooky in that closet, but the light insid eit  worked for a change.  Fifty or sixty homemade early 80's style dresses  hung in neat rows in the closet--my aunt had made them all.  I took a  few to try on and pack away-- a deep green one and a white one and one  with a crazy dark blue and pink strips and similarly-hued print of small  flowers.  
2846 20030214110607 Instanbul, not Constantinople   I was driving through an unfamiliar city.  I had been supposed to pick  someone up at a department store, but I had missed the turn. Now I had  to keep driving down an increasingly highway-like street: soon, I could  see, I was going to have to get in an interstate, unless I disobeyed the "no u-turn" sign and used the left-hand turn lane as a turnabout.   Instead, I turned left.  I turned again quickly onto a dirt road.  It was a cemetary.  A group of college-age students was emerging, sleeping  bags and backpacks in tow, from a large culvert.  Older professor types  were there to welcome them and congratualte them on "making it through."   I had the impression that all these students were from the divinity  school.  They were walking on foot through along the dirt road, so I walked with  them.  We were in a large city park, walking along a sidewalk.  I was  walking in front of three college-age women; I didn't know them, but I  introduced myself to them.  I was carrying something very important in  my backpack, the one that in real life doesn't close very well.  In  glass bottles inside my backpack I carried some sort of highly  pressurized medicine/explosive.  I wanted to be careful with these  bottles.  We had reached a sort of terraced ampitheater/skate park, sunk into the  ground.  We would have to descend the terraced walls, but the only  descent we could find at first would require us to jump about fifteen  feet.  I threw my bag down to the ground so it would not hamper me as I  jumped.  Only after I'd tossed it from my hands did I remember the  pressurized containers inside.  There wasn't anything leaking when the bag landed on the ground; I felt this was a good sign.  We were descending the terrace; as we jumped from level to level, I was  listening to a radio report on the status of inoculations and  treatments, specifically of U.S. troops and officials, in the United  States.  The terraced area turned into a sort of play room--I kept  walking into one game where a group of three people, set up in a small  triangle, used cups to toss back and forth stones they picked up from  the floor.  Norma, a custodian from Landrum, kept looking in at my friend Scotty and  two other guys who kept trying to trash the room. I left the room; in  another area, Mr. Canas, a teacher from Landrum, was talking about the  economic plight of Turkey.  Everybody was going to emigrate, he said,  into the rest of Europe. For historical refernece, he compared their economic plight to that of the northern England after the closing of the  coal mines and the decline of manufacturaing and industry.  In a far later part of my dream, there was great bay I was crossing on a  small wooden footbridge. Down, way down, in the teal blue water, a  large sea turtle was swimming. 
2853 20031126123607 1) The endless house, transformed into an outdoor labyrinth.  The walk through Nashville's newly revitalized greenway--actually a pedestrian alley, its walkways covered in white quartz and feldspar.  Walking through the night, glimpsing the ramps and walkways leading off of it, postings on the walls the work of local artists.  Later on as the buildings lessened and the walk moved from city passageways to paths through the woods, I glimpsed pheasants and a herd of deer and alpaca by the side of a stream, coming through the brush to meet us.  The beautiful stretches of woods we walked through were littered with grottoes; classical statues stood posed on half shells and old toilet bowls, next to flowing and stagnant sylvan pools alike.  2) On the other side we came out into a house, a vast collapsing warehouse, somehow the upper layer of all these woods.  The floor and walls were painted ultramarine blue, visible as a glow in the dim daylight peering in from chinks and cracks in the boarded-up windows. The boards were rotten and collapsing like the tetanus-filled chicken coop where my sisters and I used to play in childhood.  2a) Inside another section of the warehouse, I am searching for chipboard to print a project for Bryce.  All I can find are three-dimensional sheets pre-printed with models of the proposed plan of Nashville.  Bryce has hundreds of bags of paper bags, stored in a vast wooden platform.  I entertain the idea, momentarily, of printing on them.  Bryce is shaking out a box he thinks contains brown paper.  "This is what you do when you're not sure if the paper inside a box has been damaged," he says.  A rat falls out.  I do not see it, but I feel it, large as an adult opossum, by my calf.  Then it bites me, and in real life I wake up saying, "A rat, a rat!  I've been bitten by a rat.  I need to go to the hospital now."  3) Far later, in my parents' living room, the record player is on too loud, competing to be heard over the noise of the dehumidifier.  I am trying to show my Nanny a particular album cover in which a young man is standing, back to the camera, among a group of seated hippies on a hillside.  He's showing off his shirt that reads," Thanks for being an ass."  I'm not sure why I think this is appropriate to show my grandma, and I'm glad when I can't find it.  Earlier, I was playing with a tame rat who had been transformed into a kitten.  Kate and I were trying to fix an enormous clay planter we had been given.  It was hanging above the coal stove, with a hanging fern inside of it, but it was oozing wet clay out of several large cracks.  Kate got some clay on the sleeve of my angora sweater, the one that had once been my mom's. I feel somehow, earlier, as though I have disappointed my dad by not knowing how to correctly transfer feed grain from one hand to another. 
2854 20060324082208 My mom's friends Mrs. Hall and someone else from church had decided to go in and shoplift several items.  Only at first my mom was Rick's mom Lana.  I had decided to carry in one of the twenty-pound sacks of pounded chicken I had purchased earlier.  The bag was the size of a medium sizebag of potting soil.  We split up from the other ladies and walked through the supermarket aisles.  We were stopped in front of the ice bin and the Lana / my mom character picked up six bags of ice.  I was trying to carry some on my bag of chicken.  We walked through the greenhouse section, where my mom almost stole a cutting, but didn't have the right configuration to conceal it.  There was a display of strange flowers that grew on rocks; also, onthe way out of the greenhouse section, a display of the undersides of certain clumps of flowers that grew automatically in the shapes of handheld bouquets, with beautfiul stencilled patterns on the underside.  My mom was putting a canister of lip medex inside a box of tea, but as she did so a security guard came over and started to apprehend her in Spanish.  I asked him in Spanish to speak more slowly, and in English if possible.  He could not speak in English but when he spoke more slowly I understood that my mom would have to come with him to court for sentencing. I saw Mrs. Hall and the other lady standing against the front wall, already having made their "purchases", waiting for my mom. I looked back at the guard and told him my mom and I would go with him.  Nashville police officers speaking all in Spanish.  The front porch looking out onto Matamoros.  Then -- we were supposed to go on a cruise, but I would up being at my parents' home, meeting up with my friend Danielle and trying to figure out how to get down to the sea island of Louisiana, whcih is where the cruise was leaving from.  We heard a commotion from downstairs -- it wound up being my dad and mom, who were not going on the cruise after all due to my mom's arrest.  An old episode of Sesame Street was being filmed in our butler's pantry, or at least projected on the wall.  A little girl, after finishing singing, started talking, jaded, about the "music industry", acting and performing with people in "the industry", her own busy life of performing live, recording, touring and filming.  She lived in upstate NY on a commune.  One of the men filming with her turned off camera for a second to hide a smile and I caught his eye, laughing too.  He had to act as though he didn't really know what she was talking about.  THen I was chatting with that guy and another fellow who was a reggae artist but loved all kinds of music.  We were talking about music and the feeling of this part of the dream was one of great comfort and interest.  We all wanted to dance but we would have to clear out the room a bit first. 
2861 20060614081608 I met up with Mr. C the old gym teacher and Betty Polk the flautist from orchestra.  They were out front of a combo store I had ridden my bike into hoping to find parking.  Mr. C bough Betty and me Arizona Iced Tea smoothies in a can.  We were at the remnants of the Arrowmont exhibit opening reception and I was trying to steal pieces of cake from the filled-up fridge.  There were stacks of old-fashioned packaged beverage mixes, cough drops and elixirs.  I took a bunch of packages of pero, postum and cocoa, as well as some other things.  Running through the city at night with Sarah.  We were pretending to have a car but really didn't.  At soem point we were driving down a dark road taking us farther and farther away from habitation.  We turned back and drove into the center of town, tall buildings on either side of us giving way to run down warehouses.  Finally we were at a stadium down by  the river.  Sinister men kept trying to apprehend us but we kept fighting them off.  There was a giant man in one of the Bible study meetings inside.  I realized my mom's friend, GGRE GWYN, was a Welsh lady meant to help us (now a motley collection of ancient heroes) fight a great battle.  I was this young guy with magical powers but I wasn't supposed to use them until I had become a true warrior.  Eilonwy was there?  The story was happening in life and also in a sort of book, because when I stepped out of character for a bit to talk with Sarah she said that the book was itneresting because the way the people won was by sacrificing their own personal goals for the good of the group.  I couldn't remember readign that far or having drawn that lesson but it seemed like a reasonable interpretation, because right now nothing was going quite right for the heroes.   Driving along the coastline with my momand dad.  There was a power generating station on an island inthe middle of the harbor and the woman who came out of it was a giantess, or at least so it appeared from the shore (it was also partially that the building was constructed so as to look far away and tall but in reality was near and small).  As we rounded the corner my dad said about the small children's playground we passed "I've been here before."  I tried to remind my dad that I had an orchestra concert that evening and that I needed to be there by 5:30. When we got back to the house it was already almost that time.  I couldn't find the black dress I was supposed to wear.  I looked through my mom's closet for something else -- nothing.  I searched through Kate's closet -- now redone, in my mom and dad's current room.  I could not find one black skirt or pair of pants.  It was 6:09 and I though about calling Dr. C. the orchestra teacher to let him know what was happening.  I resigned myself to not go to the last concert (or to go after intermission).    
2879 20030121101807 You Look So Pretty In Your New Lace Sleeves   It was the first and second days of school rolled into one, and I was teaching in a wood-panelled trailer.  The lighting inside was dim but warm, as though we had regular 60-watt lightbulbs rather than fluorescents.  My students, fifteen or so of them, were sitting in their desks listening eagerly (despite the fact that most of them had had me as their teacher two years in a row, and could easily have discounted what I had to say as lies and empty promises).   Yesenia, as usual, was sitting completely silent, arms folded across her chest.  I tried to get her to smile and recognize me, but I couldn't do anything.  "Don't even risk it," some other adult, a teacher's aide maybe, said.  I knew something was even more wrong than usual but I would have to figure it out later.       We were going to start reading in a little bit, but first we were discussing our classroom procedures, one of which consisted of me giving the Black Power sign with my fist in the air.  The students then would respond in kind, stopping whatever they were doing to listen to instructions or announcements.   Riding on City Buses   I was in charge of driving a bus.  It may well have been a school bus, but the outside was silver and sleek like a fifties diner.  I was driving down a colonia road, unpaved and surrounded by flat farmland as far as the eye could see.  In the distance, on the horizon, piles of ramshackle corrugated steel shelters and dark threatening clouds: the border with Mexico.     A hundred or so yards down from where we were driving, just by a small house, a huge puddle spilled onto and across the road.  The fields were flooded.  I tried to brake driving into the puddle but I was still going pretty fast when I hit it.  I skidded out a little bit and realized that in the thirty seconds or so that had passed the clouds had gained on us and the fields--they looked like no clouds I had ever seen, they moved so fast and had become so dark, like night.  I turned around to drive back into town, my passengers still on the bus.  They didn't say anything.  Later, back at the house, we were getting ready for an old-skool high school orchestra rehearsal.  We were holding it outside in a summerhouse that I didn't know existed on our property.  It was rainy and wet outside.  The viola music was all in tenor clef.  I'd never seen it before (although everyone else had played these pieces many times) and for some reason I was finding it impossible to transpose.    Pretty Words   I was writing a note to myself on my arm (a bad habit that, in waking life for the past two years, I have made a concerted effort to break).  In  funny, multi-colored rainbow marker, it read, "Dear So-and-So, I really miss teaching, and all my kiddos.  I am happy but I miss them."    I was going to write it on paper, later.  
2880 20060625111408 Rode my bike around, rode it past some silversmith's shop situated back within crazy wooded corners reminiscent of Port Jefferson back roads and blind curves.  Among the people there were an amazing soccer player from Guatemala.  She was probably in her late twenties and she had had a very hard life but soccer had kept her focused.  On my bike I passed the entrance to the driveway and suddenly was past the curve and in sight of my old house, Steve and Edna's brick house.  I knew I needed to turn around fast and so I headed left into a steep driveway. Up at the top bulldozers and construction vehicles were all around and they were building an enormous house.  A couple and their child were sitting on the beams of the frame of the top level.  I saw some of the owners of the land walking across the field in out-of-date coats and jackets from the fifties.  They wore them, I knew, because they were rich and these were well-made.  One of the older ladies waved and I waved back.  I explained how I had missed my turn and wound up here to turn my bike around.  On my way downt he hill I saw Enrique Silberman.  He explained that this was the last year that he would pursue a Masters.  "Each year I apprentice myself to a Masters," he said inhis heavy accent.  "But this semester is the last."  After this semester he would not play in the orchestra any mroe either, except if they commissioned special pieces for him; then he would play in those.  "81 in all they could make," Enrique said.  We were mounting the stairs to the loft in the back room of my parents' house.  There was a carrot sprouting beneath the window.  Dr. C. was saying, "I thought I had seen Ali here," and I sheepishly called out to say that I was present, just had stepped away and now was late again.  At the top of the stairs there was a gap between the landing and the rest of the room, where the orchestra was rehearsing songs for the pops concert.  Enrique stood ont he landing and jumped across the gap , then slithered underneath a large rail and the low ceiling.  I think David fromt he viola section did the same.  I was scared.  My sister Kate kept calling out to me about some thing I was supposed to do.  Picking up jelly beans -- almost as many spilled out as I was able to pick up to put in my pocket.  There were mostly green, purple, and light green and blue among the beans I picked up.  I was trying not to let those that fell out spill to the ground as I knew it would be disruptive to the rehearsal. Some people from the orchestra came to help.  Michael Valdez came from the other side of the landing with a whole bunch of beads.  "Look at all these beads, msis," he said, and also showed me beautiful bracelets he had been making.  I explained that he could have a third to a half of the beads and a third to a half of the jelly beans so long as he helped pick up. 
2887 20030228074808 don't forget the flowers Sunday   I was walking along the riverfront in a city towards a large riverside convention center.  I was watching immigrant women in long flowing white dresses leaning perilously over the water.  One person grabbed a woman's waist, another her ankles, and then the woman, thus held, would lean almost horizontally over the river.  They were picking up and gatheing large armfuls of wrapped discarded bouquets that were floating in the water.    I had left the convention center and was driving by myself in a podunk town.  There were gigantic gaping holes in the one highway leading into the downtown, and only one supermarket.   But the supermarket was surprisingly posh--it had an amazing variety of produce.  People were getting ready for a big storm, stocking up on ridiculous things--there was a "make-your-own banana cream or meringue pie" at the salad bar section.  I was trying to eat a piece of cake in the baked goods section, but I knew that wasn't the right thing to do.  I was back in the car, driving around with my sister Kate, my old neighbor Jean Neil, and some others.  Kate was talking about the psychological effect that numbers had on her--some made her feel like dancing, some really scared or angered her, others moved her not at all.  There seemed to be no readily apparent pattern.  It extended not just to individual numbers but to arithmetical operations and even functions--she would look at a string of operations and feel a certain way.  "It's an emotional reaction to numbers," I said.  "Almost an intuitive--no, it's not intuitive, it's emotional."  Jean Neil was agreeing with Kate--she too experienced numbers this way.  We got on the subject of deja vu, which in my dream I had experienced at least three times on the same car ride.  In my dream deja vu was a flat, almost affectless feeling.  I felt kind of like someone else was acting for me, and yet at the same time I felt like I was standing on an open plain and could see what would happen for many miles on all sides.  In the car, we were trying to compare the way deja vu made us feel to see if we experienced the same thing.    At some point my mom and dad materialized in the car. We were looking for a new house to rent or buy.  The best available have already been leasd or purchased.  We end up by a large Gannett newpaper distributor.  People--including several really ruddy-faced women--are sitting outside on a large covered porch, overlooking a river, eating a spread of leftover cut fruit.   Later we were trying to find a particular street address, but succeed  only in finding a very posh sub-development.  I was inside a performance of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, only it was a cheap and less intentionally campy Christian knockoff.  Rick's friend Howard waa going to come up to Nashville and help Rick design and distribute postcards. 
2889 20060314091608 first nations  The Heron people of Australia / Oceania got on their boats and came to America to join with the First Nation people whose name began with a "P" and who lived along the Great Lakes.  They formed one nation which integrated both of their traditions and was responsible for the waterways of the Midwest and Great Lakes regions.  fitness test  The presidential fitness test that I would have to take in gym class would actually take place somewhere around where the old convent used to be on Old Post Road.  Walking there there were several dogs who tried to get out of their electric fences.  I went inside; there was a dog on its chain.  I climbed the spiral staircase just int hemiddle ofthe room.  IT turned into a fairground ride that spiraled up and down.  Now my job was to climb down it as it moved.  I was afraid to gotothe very top, so I stopped just short.  I had to use all of my strength to suspend myself from the metal "banister", which kept moving and flexing, and to catch each step as it rotated beneath me.  When I was done I jumped off as soon as I could, thanked the attendant, and ran through an old gym into an old hallway.  Mr. C and Mr. Short, the high school gym teachers were there.  Mr. Short mistook me for Jessica Cellura.  houseboat  On the open deck of an enormous boat that was, in fact, all deck, and which rolled and pitched in the heavy waves.  The sunlight was bright on the open sea.  A man was on deck beside me -- a "Daddy Longlegs" type figure, and next to me a boy who was mycousin.  I was drowsy.  Suddenly a boat appeared -- a fancy doublewide barge.  There was a swimming pool between the two sections of the house.  We moved into a congested spot with lots of boats.  Kate and I needed to go as familiy representatives to church andthen to Nanny's.  asiatic lion  My nanny was telling me the story of the "hispanic man" who kept coming by her house.  She was nervous because he, under pretence of telling her about the financial mix-up his charitable organization had gotten in, had forcibly entered her house and was scoping it out.  We were talking aobut what he could see: "Not just entrances and exits, windows and doors, but stairs -- and where you have something, and where you hae Nothing, nothings, just a bunch of Nothing," my nanny said.  I was a little worried.  I looked out the window suddenly to see something moving on a little rise.  It looked like it might be a deer or asmalldog.  Suddenly I realized it was a mangy but muscular lion, and that it was the same man who had come by my nanny's house.  Seeing me he was trying to come in through the screen but still could not.  I rolled up a newspaper and tried swatting him with it on the nose, which just irritated him.  I told my sister to get Nanny out of there quickly through the front door and I would quickly figure out how to trap the lion.   
2890 20060727103808 yesterday (7/26): wearing the wedding dress at work at finer things.  it had a long lace train that, when i looked back, i realized i had ripped perfectly around a single rose.  kim also had on a white dress but it was not a wedding dress and of course i felt rather silly having to carry the train behind me, watch where i was going, etc.  outside in the grey overcast day franne lee was standing on the porch in front of the locked and shuttered gallery doors.  she was in a pink fuzzy bathrobe with some sort of cream-colored lining and she was haranguing a crowd of people also assembled ont eh porch.  she wanted to be let in.  today (7/27): the woman who called on the phone was from a foreign land. as she spoke i saw before me on our kitchen table a flat map that assumed depth as i looked within it.  the equator, which was called something else, ran through europe, bisecting the netherlands (now to the west of france), germany, france, and much of eastern europe.  it was because of the water that encircled them that england and ireland, wales and scotland were so cold, i reasoned.  the woman was from a francophone country.  i was trying to explain  why she might like attending watkins.  however the connection was bad; i didn't really have the info i needed; the wind was picking up outside making it hard tohear; sarah was on her cell phone and kept making hand gestures that she needed to talk with me.  there were long patches where i just ignored the woman on the phone (i couldn't hear her talking).  the trees were moving in every direction and the wind was making a groaning sound. "it's a tornado," i said.  "let's go downstairs."  sarah and i went to the basement.  we went into the side room where we will put the root cellar.  i sat int he dark closet spot, sitting under a three foot cobweb that stretched diagonally across like a safety belt. i realized that the door to the outside at the top of the three steps had only a screen and that the outside wall was just a short foundation, about a foot and a half high, and then a screen covered with black plastic.  if something fell in we would not be protected.  i pointed it out to sarah and she said, "i never realized that."  we moved into the other section.  outside a warehouse bryce asked me if i ever did any production work at finer things.  he was asking me why i left his shop.  he was also asking if i would consider doing more work where i produced stuff other artists designed.  i explained that i was still willing to do that and that i had thought about making tee-shirts with other people's designs.  i explained that my aims in doing that sort of work were to become more technically proficient.  it was a grey day that felt out of place for summer.  all the leaves on the trees were turning color like fall and this made me feel strange inside, happy and sad at the same time.  
2905 20030717193007 dream of 14 july Dreamt of alina, somewhere.  The beautiful boy and his numerous blind dates--he encounters one by the post outside the house,  remembers his face but cannot remember his name.  The boy he once went on a blind date with has two big soft front teeth; there are  cavity spots on them that are almost blue.  His aunt had set the two of them up.  I saw an ad I had designed--it had been misprinted and the picture that had supposed to appear with it had been replaced with an empty  beach at sunset.  I dreamt we listened to a new cd my father had given me in real life--  Ego Scriptor Cantilenae  , the musical works of Ezra Pound.  Though  I had never listened to the whole cd before, I knew, somehow, the exact sounds that would come next.  dream of 15 july  In reverse: I dreamt an outbuilding filled with people about to play a game of soccer; my clothes ill-suited to sports, as usual.  Someone  was reading from a long skinny rectangular book.  The cashmere set and the workers' rights movement--the charismatic priest in overalls  leading a march for workers' rights accompanied by members of the Old Rich.  Mr. Dwyer, my old high school track coach, and his hand,  a pale green gold.  Three untanned patches marked the spots where he wore three different watches--one for each of his duties at various  points in the day--teacher, coach, family man.  His children, Guatemala and A---, riding up on the long slow bus ride from Central  America.  The line outside the outbuilding; we were waiting to be inspected by Immigration Services.  The crumbling statue, a stone giant, lying on  its side on the hill out past the deserted greenhouse buildings, against the mud-grey sky.    The inflatable submarines launched from the ship.  Their landing patterns followed a certain theorem, the Brehznov Hypothesis.  They  always landed upright.  We got to ride on top of them, behind the ship on the high seas.  The newspaper publishing house--hanging out with Thomas Petillo and another woman who kept trying to put a silver chain around my  waist.  The workers with unusual names accompanied me out to the ground floor, where I had to remember the quickest way to walk back  to main campus.    Writing in Russian was advertising some alcoholic beverage--only the Russian was just a phonetic transliteration of French.  17 july  I do not remember my dream of the night before, though I exhibited a certain genius for sleep by napping on the train all the way to and  from the city, two hours each way.  In my dream of last night Rick was going to a reconciliation with someone; I wanted to go but I knew I  couldn't.  Rick was telling me about his preparations for it.  Interminable night, brown-black like cross-hatching in sepia ink.  I looked out  in darkness to see that the old-fashioned handle on the outside of the passenger side back door of our Malibu had been broken. 
2907 20030311092407 it's the end of the world as we know it   I was trying on costume jewelry and my sister's clothes in her room at our parents' home.  The costume jewelry was amazing--a set of clip-on earrings in the shape of clockwork owls, with giant eyes of turquoise; a stetchable bracelet of red lucite and another of many red wooden parts.  Then we were in an isolated village at sea or in a sleepy bayou. The  time was perpetual sunset. In the words of our nice Olive Oyl-style hostess, with her black flipped bob ad gangly demeanor, we were staying in a "boat truck stop".  We were solving a puzzle in the paper together.  Former solutions were listed in columns all up and down the paper: a list of strange, pseudo-upscale foods, including "lobster divan icee".  I went outside walking around with my dinner; I passed a pub on the other side of the house boat.  Past the pub, I was in a deep woods with a rain-filled sky above me. There was a wooden crows' nest/observation platform above me; I wanted to climb up it so I could eat up there, high above the ground.  Lightning flashed and thunder snapped so near me I thought it had hit me.  I ran back to the pub for safety, but it struck again, very near me, as I reached the sheltered porch. My ears were ringing.  I was so dazed, and my body felt so electrically charged, that I could not get up on the porch.  Some man eating pub lunch helped me up.  The two women running operations inside were both British; one was also the mother of David Wright, a friend from college.  We caught up about him, although part of the time my friend Alex was talking by proxy through one of these women.  We were back at Olive Oyl's place.  She was saying how much she would like to make some of these foods listed in the word puzzle.  (They all sounded hideous to me, like something out of   the Gallery of Regrettable Food .)  Alas (for her), she couldn't, because they lived on this houseboat in Outer Boondoggle somewhere, and she didn't even have a full-size freezer to buy some stuff in bulk and store it.    I was looking at map of the former Soviet Republic; comparing it in size to the U.S.  I was a spy.  Later on, we were by the sea.  Sis Kate had taken something important of mine.  The world was going to end shortly and I was going to kill myself before that happened, becuase sis Kate and my mom had betrayed me.  But first I wanted to get this document from Kate.  Then Kate was her young (six- or seven-year old) self, and I was about ten or eleven. A teenage boy apperaed and beagan telling his saga: he was very smart but he had never attended classses--because they were boring, because he could get away with getting out of them, and because he had a psycological condition that prevented him from staying in class.  I saw where sis Kate had hidden the document--in a trick rock by an aloe plant.  I ran over and wrestled it away from her.  
2915 20060527082208 I was so mad!  I had left my katazome stencils soaking in the bathtub for about tenty-four hours.  When, remembering them, I went in to retrieve them, I picked them up and found that the ink I had used to lacquer them had soaked away, and the netting and paper separated in the process.  I carried them into my studio anyway to let them dry off.  They were falling apart and there was likely no way for me to repair them, or even use them to cut new stencils.  My mm looked them over doubtfully.  "You really made the fragada," she said.   I was so mad I growled, a clenched noise that started out low and ended in a sort of howl.  It made me wake up into real life.  I looked around and was awake.  I realized that my stencils were really still in the bathtub soaking.  I went to go pull them out and then hung them up to dry and went back to sleep.  Later in the old manor home, seemingly never-ending, I was at first just following around rich and / or highly intelligent people from various UK universities.  I didn't really belong in there but had gotten in somehow for a lecture or sanctioned tour.  A rich rich lady in suit and pearls and a young lady, only about nineteen or so but a highly accomplished political philosopher, were using a secret old elevator.  A guide saw them and said, somewhat disapprovingly, "That's a rarely used way to get around," but she couldn't say anything more because the rich lady was a trustee.   Then I realized that I could slip down various halls and find secret passageways.  I was I came across the library of the theater program and then, several flights of a twisting narrow stair later, the tiny attic office and publishing room of the young political theorist. She had a strange poster with a hand-written note about Cambridge and not giving it positive credit in the magazine she published.  Underneath was a paean to America: some stuff beforehand, then, "Bless most of all the American silence".  We watched the parade of people on foot while we sat stuck in traffic. I wanted to take the ferry over to the small island but the ferry was probably broken.  I was back in college and meeting my roommate for the first time, via Rick's cousin (but actually my cousin in the dream), who as usual was exquisitely made up, making me feel like somewhat of a dog. We had to walk up a bunch of stiars in a very brightly-lit central stair shaft to get up tomy room.  The stairs made me feel kind of dizzy and my room was at the top on the sixth floor.  I worried that I would not be able to get there on a day-to-day basis.  My roommate and the cousin figure were good friends.  There were windows that faced west and I thought about bringing some plants as I wasn't sure they would survive at home in my absence.  I was trying to find alternate ways to get to the result of 25 x 32 (? - the number I had was not equal to the product of these two numbers). 
2943 20030908020207 9/6  In the bible supply store, trying to return a paper bag which I had taken accidentally.  There were no Bibles here--they were housed in another building.  Here, the shelves were filled with light reading, the Christian equivalent of pulp fiction.  There was a whole section of "women's books"--Biblical and Christian romances (habit rippers?), self-help tracts, and Christian humor.  Erma Bombeck's posthumous classic, "Dear God, Just Let Me..." was among the highlighted offerings.  But those weren't what I was looking for--I was searching, very specifically, for a book of spiritual guidanc meant just for me.  Awkwardness at the cash register as I tried to return the bag--one young cashier, a mother of three, had just quit her job in a huff.  The cashier, it turned out, was the mother of my lost student Elenita, who stood there with her two brothers for a bit.  Then I was up in a balcony, only about seven feet above the ground, looking on as Elenita danced.  People next to me were trying to explain Elenita's incomprehensible behavior--bad family circumstances, a lack of structure.  But everything Elenita had done seemed normal enough to me.    Watching Elenita dance, sing, and act, I talked with the person next to me about setting up an acting class for students.  Suddenly the loudspeaker swelled with the opening bars of "Gotta Dance"--from   Singing in the Rain   .  The crowd sitting in folding chairs throughout the auditorium simultaneously swept themselves off their own feet and rose to dance--gradually winding their way into a congo line snaking through the folding chairs.  9/7 Rick and I step out into the sunlight, into a parking lot filled with glass.  A large woman with a pink top and black pants approaches us.  "And are you gonna take me to the airport?" she asks.  We aren't.  In the supermarket, Rick grabs two refrigerator cases of diet Dr Pepper, and two bags of corn flakes--one frosted, one not.  "Get me some bread, please," he asks.  "And do you need milk too?" I ask--"Get me a glass container, just a quart, if you can," he tells me.  Walking through the endless bakery section, I want to eat the sweet breads with the glazed fruit on top.  At the salad bar, I admire the congealed fruits and vegetables compacted in the serving bowls like stratas of colored confetti.  A woman watches me gaze at the bowl longingly.  "I'll get a plate for you and a plate for me, if you want," says a middle-aged white woman, tailed by two black girls, her children.  Outside--I learn the building is a business school.  The school is going to auction off a man's shoes--a well-known businessman and graduate of the program before it got a facility of its own.    A computer on our bed, not working.  Yet Brandon's website pops up, with comments--a woman writes, in verse I cannot remember, to this effect: "It's too bad we finally begin to know how you feel and you go away for the weekend."   
2959 20030205075008 ars domestica   In a Wal-Mart,I was looking through ugly fashionable clothes, including one atrocious short-sleeved sweater made out of white acrylic.  It had a scoop neck that was run through with baby blue ribbon (to make it into kind of a peasant blouse, since you could pull the ribbon to make the sweater more fitted) and fake eyelet running across the chest.  It was $ 25.97.  I was indignant. A large adolescent boy and his mother were looking through fabric that seemed like pieces of giant bloomers.    In another aisle I was buying cocoa.  I walked down a couple of aisles to one labelled, among other things, "Chi-Chi's", by which I understood it to offer salsa.  There was a section of Mexican canned sauces.  I couldn't find what I was looking for at first, and almost picked up a can of something akin to spicy sun-dried tomatoes in a metal can.  When I exited the aisle, I met up with an employee--a middle-aged woman with bobbed blonded hair that was kind of frizzy at the end.  As we talked, she knelt down and swept small piles of dirt off the floor.  She offered to walk me to the right places as she swept the floor As we walked and she swept, she explained in her Eastern European accent how Wal-Mart and other stores like it had changed our habits and our expectations.  "Now we are so fragmented," she said, "because we do not know where things really come from.  We go to one store that has everything but we don't know where the things are from.  It's open twenty-four hours so we have no idea about natural rhythms of activity and inactivity."  She was looking at the shiny tile floor of the area by the fashionable ugly clothes and the bloomer material, which had items tossed across it.  "There is always stuff tossed all over the floor," she said, "because people don't know where it comes from to put it back."  I had to go home and the woman, leaning on my arm, walked me out. She was from somewhere in the Balkans--Croatia, maybe.  When we reached the curb I asked her how to say "happy new year".  "Ponimayu" she answered (which actually means "I understand" in Russian).  "Dobro ponimayu pojalsta," I said as I walked across to my car.  In a small classroom I was teaching a group of people my age or slightly younger how to clean bathrooms.  We were all living together and this had become a problem--no one was cleaning the bathrooms.  We were discussing how we would know if the bathroom needed cleaning, but I also was saying that these niceties didn't matter.  All the bathrooms were dirty and needed cleaning--and probably needed cleaning once a week. I had to reprimand one student who looked like Carl Paparella, a short freckled red-headed wise ass from my high school.  It was nearly the end of class, and unfortunately Carl had to stand in a time-out area until the session waas over.  Somebody was showing me the electricity bill, which was $ 595 and something cents.  I was a little freaked out.  
2962 20060115143008 Watching or filming a tv miniseries / afterschool special.  A kid was going to get tricked into being unspeakably cruel and violent towards another child.  The kid who would be tricked into being cruel was uncool and longing for acceptance; the kid he would be cruel to was a social pariah, loved by no one, yet endearing and kind.  Isolation and ridicule had not hardenend him and he remained innocent.  He was not book or street smart but he had a holy sort of wisdom and benevolence.    Cut to scenes of people conspiring in the school hallways.  Somehow the sweet kid was a school janitor.  The other kids were amassing a load of concrete, stealing it from the onsite closets where it was stored, plotting to bury the one kind janitor kid alive in it.  They drove away with it, having gotten the janitor kid to come out to meet the kid who had been roped into this plot. Then there was no exposition of the scene where they buried him alive, only the suggestion that they weren't able to bury him alive so much as stick him into the wet concrete after beating him up a bunch.  Then cut to a scene of an older Italian janitor driving with the kid roped into the plot sitting next to him.  It's raining outside, maybe.  Older janitor:  "I dunno where the sacks of concrete could be.  DO you ahve any idea?" Young kid roped into plot: "I don't know, Lenny, I really don't know." Older Janitor: "This is bizarre, I've got to phone this in to the office."  The young kid's face is harrowed with pain and his eyes are like two dark sockets in his head.  His hair is greasy and his face pale and sweaty as though he has been up all night.  Then cut to a city street and one kid walking down the road.  The camera pans in on an alcove with a public wastebasket.  Sticking out of it are a pair of white sneakers attached to a red running suit -- the kid who they had attempted to bury alive, now shoved, dead or half-dead, in the wastebasket.  The camera turns back to this kid walking up the street. He does a double take.  He walks back to the wastebasket and his eyes widen in horror.  He is running running to get someone to help.  Then it is our own home.  I walk into the living room.  There is my extended family and RIck, sitting.  Rick was somehow involved in the burial.  I run  into the living room where everyone is sitting and I start screaming at him.  I state what had happened and berate him for being part of it.  I scream and scream and scream but each time people seem to care less.  I cannot get my point across -- whether the boy lives or dies, is better or worse for the incident, we all cannot help but have suffered for it; we cannot help but have made ourselves worse through participation.    Later I realize the real reason I am hurt, and I try to tell Rick.  If he, who I think of as one person who tries mostly to do what is right, does something so wrong, where can I, who do much wrong, find a compass for what is right? 
3001 20030118064007 My sis Sarah had just returned from an evening out with her friends.  She had been supposed to stay out all night, but she had lost a leather bound journal--"Historical Replica Day Book," it had said on the cover--that my parents had given her in honor of her spring semester internship in Washington D.C.  She was calling all of the numerous clubs and bars that she and her friends had frequented that night, in the vain hope of locating the journal.    My dad was giving her flak for having lost the journal, but I was explaining how Rick had lost a metal-bound journal in a similar fashion (well, not after a night of drunken debauchery, but out on the town somewhere, presumably in front of our bank).  Somehow my family had instituted the practice of saying "link" (a la college and high school debaters) when ever we wanted to connect the point we were making with another point someone had just made.  As we said it, a visual depiction of our idea, or just a large blank luminous rounded speech-bubble, hung above our heads just to our left sides.  Later, I was in a large class in a lecture hall.  At various points the hall was darkened, as for a media presentation; at other times, the walls disappeared and we were sitting in a field of reeds. There were several (about four) long rows (about fifty desks) of seats on each side of the hall, with a long nave in between them.    My political philosophy professor from college was leading the class in a discussion about political duty.  I was growing increasingly angry because I was sitting on the "cool" side of the class, where everybody was  talking amongst themselves  and not paying atention to the lesson.  It almost came to fisticuffs with one gentleman who said something under his breath to the professor about being quiet.  " You  haven't been quiet all year," I said to him.  "Why don't you start now to make up for lost time?"  Other people were complaining because of the way in which the professor led the discussion.  "The hall is too big.  He lectures too much.  We cannot move around," one student said.  And indeed, the professor was trying to move from student to student to get their opinions, but was hampered by the terrain ofthe room and his willingness to actually listen to what each student had to say--a logistical nightmare in a class of 300 students.  Families searching for aid were filing up and down the side alleys of the classroom.  My friend Laura Beth called two young girls over to the vending area, where we were sitting.  "What do you want?" she asked, pointing to the 25 cent toy machines.  "I suppose your other two sisters will want something too."     On the bus, which had the same layout as the lecture hall, I was sitting next to my childhood friend Laura.  "O Canada, O Canada," I was singing, "come light the menorah."    "No," I said to myself, "that's not it...It's 'O Canada, O Canada, come light the maple leaves...' Darn...what can they dance that rhymes with "Canada"?"

I was I came across the library of the theater program and then, several flights of a twisting narrow stair later, the tiny attic office and publishing room of the young political theorist. She had a strange poster with a hand-written note about Cambridge and not giving it positive credit in the magazine she published. Underneath was a paean to America: some stuff beforehand, then, "Bless most of all the American silence".  This was meant to indicate her belief that lack of interference was the most fundamental principle of liberty.  We watched the parade of people on foot while we sat stuck in traffic. I wanted to take the ferry over to the small island but the ferry was probably broken. I was back in college and meeting my roommate for the first time, via Rick's cousin (but actually my cousin in the dream), who as usual was exquisitely made up, making me feel like somewhat of a dog. We had to walk up a bunch of stiars in a very brightly-lit central stair shaft to get up tomy room. The stairs made me feel kind of dizzy and my room was at the top on the sixth floor. I worried that I would not be able to get there on a day-to-day basis. My roommate and the cousin figure were good friends. There were windows that faced west and I thought about bringing some plants as I wasn't sure they would survive at home in my absence.  I was trying to find alternate ways to get to the result of 25 x 32 (? - the number I had was not equal to the product of these two numbers).  
3008 20030504105407 We found an old abandoned house, my family and I, and were storing items in it.  It was a beautiful old house, built in the early part of last century.  The ceilings were very high and all the walls were white.  There were closets everywhere that seemed like tricks. They were filled with clothing and bric-a-brac and boxes--but I knew that if I cleared these items away and really looked at the back of them I would find secret passageways.  We had to take some of the items we'd stored in the house back over to our house, which was about a quarter of a mile away.  There were two large pieces of furniture my mom had placed in the house: a secretary and a china cabinet/chest of drawers.  She needed to take at least one back for my Nanny, who was coming to stay with us.  The secretary was filled with heavy fragile items that would be close to impossible to move.  I was hoping we would not have to move it, but my Nanny suddenly appeared, asking loudly when her furniture for her guest suite would arrive.    In a tiny storage area off to the side at the entrance of the house, I found a window with trucks bustling by on their way to a catering house.  I was not wearing a shirt and I kept trying to duck so the drivers wouldn't see me.  On the shelves of the half-deserted storage area were  scraps of polished wood, old canisters and casks, a three sectioned package of ancient dried fruit and nuts.  I was with numerous people from high school and my family.  We were at one point in the woods, the midpoint of a hike, and we were supposed to return to another point within the hour.  I had settled in a big old house, but I was snooping around in the house of Melea Bollman, a teacher from TFA.  She had just had a roommate move in with her into her old and beautiful house down the street.  I looked in the window.  In their downstairs kitchen/dining area, roughly the size of our entire current bottom floor, the floors were dark parquet and the lighting dim and warm.  Melea had a drum set made of green jade-like crystal, with parchment paper drum heads.  I walked over to her kitchen table, set for two, and started looking through her oaken crate full of parts for the game Scattergories.  I wanted to borrow it.  Melea came in with her new roommate and we started talking.  I was in an open field, waiting in some bleachers for a high school concert or sporting event to begin.  I found a scrap of tooth in my mouth.  I looked at my mouth: the sections that my dentist had put fillings in were uneven.  Jagged edges of the old tooth stuck up above the new low filled section in three places.  Hurka was the name of an Iraqi doctor who had led a resistance movement in Iraq, and with whom I was going to work on helth issues.  There was a science/outdoor adventure camp; each half was symbolized by one of the two blankets I was using.  The two camps had distinct prposes--one for academics, one for developing social skills, but I couldn't get clear which blanket was which. 
3028 20030408092807 There was a mini-orchestra rehearsal just in front of the stage in my  old middle school auditorium.  Then suddenly we were marching along a   dusty road, a whole school band.  It was going to rain anytime, and some  flute, clarinet, and trumpet players towards the back were playing the  opening to Beethoven's Fifth.  I was joining them on my viola.  We got  to the area we were searching for--a baseball diamond.  I was concerned  because I had left my wallet some miles back along the side of the road,  with a bunch of our other stuff.  I don't know how it happened, but we started looking at a historical  coloring book about colonial South Africa--a sugary sweet coloring book.   On one bank of of a placid and lush European-looking river, Victorian ladies promenaded and strolled with parasols and lapdogs.  Pretoria  time, Afrikaans time, Colonial time, Jolly Wall River time--the coloring  book explained how the settlers used all these times, but not Greenwich  Meant Time. The coloring book also had a picture of the the  Jolly Wall River wending "its happy way" past a bank filled with  "attractive and high-ranking young women from the very best backgrounds,  hired (!) to circulate along the river bank in exchange for trinkets and  pocket change."  Then the picture shifted, to a contemporary t.v. show about naughty  people at the beach caught on film.  One woman had just had a baby; she  sent her husband off for something and kissed someone else.  He came  back, however, because he saw it on t.v.  "She tries to make it up to  him, but he goes off, angry," the voiceover commented.  The woman and  her baby sank underwater.  "Despite his young age, the baby always tries  to smooth things over," the voiceover continued.  The woman and the baby were sitting on the bottom of a very clear lake for several minutes.  I  looked closer at the image--there was a water snake, a coral snake  lookalike, banded yellow, red, black, swimming dangerously close to  them.  I was trying to figure out whether it was dangerous.  I was trying to  remember the jingle--"red, yellow, black, won't harm Jack; red, black,  yellow, kill a fellow", but none of the rhymes seemed right.  Besides,  the snake had turned into a shirt, the shirt of the man that had walked  away.  The snake was inside of his shirt and I was trying to decide if  it would bite him or if it woudl be hurt if you tried to wash the shirt.  Then we were in a hotel, preparing to eat.  The waiter set up a bunch of  stuff at the "week table."  I was trying to sit there to eat until the  man with a snake in his shirt explained that it was a sort of buffet  table.  I poured myself the last of the water and then looked all over  for a water filter.   I couldn't find one, bbut I found my Aunt Ginny,  and then we went outside, where the Swiss Alps had been superimposed on  the location of my parents' street.  My family was gathering before my  mother's house for some holiday.    ---------   above:  Tui, The Joyous - Lake, mist, marsh
3034 20030724100807 By a lake, on a dock, people were getting ready to launch their rowboats in the water.  My student Jeli had gone out in one and now she waved at me from the water.  The boat capsized suddenly and Jeli was left bobbing in the water until she found her footing and started walking towards the dock, despite the boat being out so far from shore.  There was an enormous prehistoric beast, a cross between a duck and a dinosaur, green and scaly and beaked, with talons, small front limbs that it held close to its chest, and powerful back legs, good for running long distances.  I glimpsed it from down the windy stone steps that led down to the lake, kind of like the walls of an ampitheater.  The creature glimpsed me, too, and started running after me.  I could tell that it was both hungry and vengeful.    I ran up the steps, hoping that their narrowness and age would slow the creature down, but it was indifferent to the challenge.  I ducked in and out of massive rock gulches and narrow passageways hoping to deceive it, or get it wedged in some crevice from which it could not escape.  The whole time, I had the suspicion that the pursuit was taking place on the flip side of the fourth grade wing in my elementary school; that somehow the school had been overrun by creatures of the past and transformed into a place at once familiar and terrible.  Then I escaped into one of the halls of my old elementary school.  I ran past the office and the cafetorium and glimpsed, where the personnel offices used to be, a secret meeting-room.  I ducked in, because I had seen, coming down the hall, the quick lumbering beast and now, an awful (but beautiful) rider.   I cowered in the meeting room, but the beast and the rider did not see me.  But they were circling and circling.  I was in a complex of buildings somewhat like the science research area on Stony Brook's campus.  Kate was calling mom, but my mom did not really want to talk to me.  I relaized I had a tray of baked ziti that needed to be stored for a big party.  I brought it to Mrs. Sandoval-Martinez's room--the young teacher at Landrum--and set it down. I asked her if I could store it there, but as I wrapped it up to refridgerate it, I realized that I was supposed to leave that next day to go away.  I wrapped in a large clear plastic bag that a newspaper had come in, and left detailed instructions for reheating it.  My sister Sarah was begging me to return home for a special day when everyone would be off from work at the same time.  But I couldn't change my vacation days--I was already returning that Friday to go home.  I was outside, trying to tidy up my backpack.  I realized that it was the only thing I would be able to take on the plane with me--I wouldn't have time to go by my house and pick up anything else.  I remembered that I had a long paper on the decline of the Ottoman Empire due when I got back, and that I didn't have any of my research materials.  I would have to write the paper from memory and fill in the details later. 
3054 20060807100608 Hilda could see ghosts in our room but we were not sure if they were ghosts or just manifestations of people's emotions inside the room.  A young girl was taking me through the floors of an old house that had been converted into their school / operations plant.  When we walked up the flight of stairs to the third floor and she went out onto the thinly tarred roof I began to get woozy; as she shimied up pillars and off to the very edge of the roof I had to stay very still, sometimes sinking down to the floor or against a pillar for support.  We had one more set of stairs to climb and they were rickety, without guardrails, extending straight up from the center of the room.  I was hoisting myself up them with all my strength and reflecting on how silly it had been to wear this flaring grey silky tennis skirt.  There was an adolescent boy behind me, then the girl, and I offered to let the boy pass me since he was a slightly faster climber (and kept looking up my skirt).    Inside a strange lodgewith different rotating sections sampled from other houses, each designed by a different designer, Tiffany was standing in the kitchen and we were talking about her project.  My mom came in and there was a strange rustling underneath the fridge.  "Is it ..."  I began to say.  "A rat?" my mom finished.  "Yes, it is."  The neighbor cat, reminiscent of my aunt and uncle's old cat Kate, darted under the firdge and started chomping away.  "Did she get it?" I asked, and TIffany mentioned something aobut her just getting the head, which, when I looked beneath the fridge, I saw was true.  Sam Callahan was showing me an amazing book with detailed maps and aerial views of all over the immediate area.  I looked to find where we were.  I knew on the hillside beyond us stood the College of Scarritt Bennett,whcih was not the one in Nashville but a sort of goblin-town like collection of castle parts and gothic buildings.  On the map I could see the spot wher Sam and Tiffany would get a studio together, the strange house of their landlord next door.  There were four braille bumps on each map and supposedly if youput your finger over them you could be oriented to the place onthe map where you were standing.  I did notunderstand howthis would work.  We were trying to leave.  There was int he hallway first a recreation of a house made in a cave.  I walked into a room where TIffany and Eric were to find out if it made anyone else feel claustrophobic.  Out in the hallway again, dark hallway, high bookshelves and a woman descending deeper and deeper underground, to escape or discover something.  Sarah and I were repeatedly trying toleave.  Around a small card table a bunch of people were sitting.  SOmeone was talkinga bout hte recent loss of George Harrison's wife.  Dave Trachtenberg piped up and mentioned Karen's mom's friend ("Melody"?) who had become George Harrison's second wife.  I was typing somehting at the computer.  DOug Feltman was resting his head on my shoulder.  Green thistles were growing from the ground. 
3063 20030415091407 I'm in a rock ___________________   I'm in an elementary school classroom with my 6th grade teacher, Ms. Milburn, and a bunch of kids from high school.  Jen Braun is at the front of the class, sitting in one desk and resting her feet on another. Ryan Bernholz is following me around, inexplicably.  We are copying some math problem from the board to solve.  Our copying doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because we are copying down an expression that features the absolute value of zero, factorial, times zero raised to the power of zero, times the absolute value of negative zzero, factorial.  But for some reason there's a complex algebraic substitution that we have to do to solve the problem "the proper way."  The teacher shows us some algebraic expression that she's obtained by plugging in some variables to the first expression and taking the derivative.  She tells us to use it to solve another problem she puts on the board.  My math notebook is full, and I don't have extra paper.  Nor does Ryan Bernholz.  We ask Jen Braun for some and she hands us some old manila sheets from underneath a teacher's cabinet.  But they have small childrens' compositions on them, and I am reluctant to use them.  We return them and take sheets of wide ruled manila, of the sort you use in public school when you are just learning to write in kindergarten.   I walk outside after consulting with a shaggy-haired Ben Cheng about why I cannot get the correct answer for the math problem.   In a music room, a man in a full piece sleeveless jumpsuit with a painted on collar and tie is teaching the bass to someone playing the violin.  He's five minutes away from a mullet.   I'm making my way to the cafeteria.  Eveyone is lined up in hte hall, ostensibly by class, but out teacher is no where to be found, and students in our class are running wild.  I walk back towards a stage.  A young woman is playing piano while her mother plays a traditional Chinese instrument.  The girl is trying to tune her piano, somewhat like a harp, as she is playing.  She's using her feet, at points, to tap out notes as she tightens strings and re-adjusts hammers.  I'm helping her pluck out some notes, as the keys move by themselves, like a player piano.  The piano hammers are in a pile in the middle of of the piano; they look like a pile of black and brown  cuisenaire rods .  I've never seen such a bad sonic symphonic collapse," the girl says. Other people are getting on stage and just playing string instruments along with the piano and the chinese instrument.    I want to play too.  There's a jazz band, and while it and some violins are playing together, I run off the sttage and try to get back to my classroom, where my viola is.  A floor to ceiling door, like a garage door, almost closes on me.  I keep running through seemingly endless halls.  I run through a buffet area.  I can hear that the folks on stage are playing the opening bars of   Unfair  by Pavement, over and over again, and I desperately want to play it too.  But I can't get my viola.    
3116 20030204085807 Tokyo Storm Warning   The freezer door of our downstairs refrigerator was broken; there was a thin plastic strip torn from the bottom of the door that prevented the door from shutting completely.  Cold air was leaking from the bottom of the door.  A former occupant of the house, college-age, was over and noticed the door.  "I knew something was wrong all along," he said.  "I just couldn't see where it was."  I didn't know how I could fix it without the missing plastic part.  The only ideas that came to mind involved duct tape.    Some friends, Rick, and I were standing by a restaurant waiting for it to open.  (We were standing by a place that actually exists--a Japanese restaurant, kind of seedy looking, that just recently has replaced a Chinese restaurant (the sort that calls itself "Oriental") right by the West End Dairy Queen.)    However, the restaurant was still under construction.  The rest of the group wanted to leave in a huff, but I was trying to explain what "the true Japanese way" would be to indicate that we were disappointed that the restaurant was not open, but looked forward to visiting it some other time.    "We write  tenno  (the restaurant's name) on a 3"x5" index card in brush calligraphy," I said.  "Since we don't know what it means, we have to  look it up  and include our definition subtly in our brief note."  My dreaming eye pulled back away from the scene;I was watching myself and the other people talk.  A large index card floated down in front of us, with  tenno  already hand-lettered on it.  The land around us was bare and grey, stripped down like winter; I saw that we were on top of a hill and the restaurant had become a temple.  The scene ended with this vision of us in front of the temple-restaurant, an index card hovering before us like the credits for a movie.  Somwhow, later on, we got inside a restaurant--not the one we had intended, but another seedy Japanese place, "The Japanese Diner", or something like that.  It was full of fifties-style diner gadgets, the most impressive of which was a fifty button wall-mounted self-serve drink dispenser.  There were buttons for everything--rice wine, black tea (with or without honey-?!), soft drinks of all sorts, green tea milkshakes, "sake shakes".  There was a one page laminated menu, complete with cheesy clip art from a desktop publishing program's "create your own menu" template.    I put only one forlorn ice cube in my plastic tumbler and filled it up with black tea (with honey).  Back at the table, people were discussing the ineffective drill seargant they had encountered at a military training exercise.  The man had been dressed in an orange, prison-style jumpsuit, and had been shouting out his orders among the cardboard fronts of a studio set Western town.  The walls and streets were of clay.  The drill seargant was shouting, feebly, the same orders over and over. Rick and I were repeating the same command at the same monotonous pitch, mimicking his voice.  But I gradually woke up, realizing that the command I was hearing over and over was the alarm clock beeping.   
3119 20060411113807 Walking through endless subterrenean passages of a house I have been through in different parts of many dreams.  Perhaps we descended in rickety elevators or climbed spiral staircases; now I can't remember. Later, after we had walked through the stalls of artisans selling hand-crafted wares and the large rooms of musicians playing tunes and selling their merchandise and lessons, I went out to meet my mom and sister only to find that my mom had thoughtfully loaded my viola and another fiddle inside the trunk.  Only it was not my fiddle (at least, I didn't think I had brought it), and my viola was in an old ratty case, not my own.  I was angry at my mom instead of grateful.  She was apologetic and explained that I had just left without taking care of my instrument, and she hadn't been sure whether I was coming back for it or not, so she took it with her -- but didn't know how to pack it up, as I hadn't left any instructions.  This made me feel worse.  I went back to look for it.  The fair was closing up and I wandered around the U-shaped hall of galleries where I had spent the most time.  I glanced half-heartedly over piles of merchandise and taken-down display materials but did not start searching thoroughly.  A couple was searching through the monuments at the state capitol building in Nashville, looking for a place to hook up.  But they settled instead under a small oak sapling in Braintree, Massachussetts.  Their public hook-up was a form of protest against a government that instruded into people's private spaces and against a culture that denied the public ownership of outdoor spaces and our individual capacity to make them at once our own and everyone's.  Inside a large warehouse with my sister Sarah and then with the girls from  All-of-a-Kind Family .  A restaurant had recently moved into the space, and Ben Vitualla's work was up everywhere.  I tried to explore the cavernouse rooms, damp and white-washed, off to the sides, but kept getting scared off by the lanky owner, who kept carting off debris and junk from the rooms.  Beyond one dark room I peered into you could see a courtyard filled with all sorts of colorful outdoor dining furniture, cooking equipment, and other strange treasures.  From the way the courtyard was angled and the hint of woods beyond one could almost guess that this was just another variation of the never-ending hosue with innumerable rooms to explore.  I went into another side room where my young sister and the other girls were.  They were playing with toys -- plastic rocking horses on metal springs, mylar balloons in unusual shapes that floated up as soon as we walked past them, and trampoline on its side that I cautioned my sister and Henny not to turn around -- as I knew the owner was on to us being in this forbidden part of the warehouse.  Sure enough as Henny jumped another waiter from the building came over and told us we needed to leave this part of the building.  But we dawdled as we left and, even though I saw the owner glare at us as he walked by with arms full of trash, I knew we would come back and explore.  
3123 20030115121007 Even More Stupid than Nair   "I want my legs to be silky smooth," I told my mom, so she told me that we would need to pour and cast them out of plaster.  We got out the molds and got to work.   Testing Regime  Earlier--many separate small groups of people were assembling for a meeting in a large dimly-lit train station or airport.  Among them were people from my childhood, people from high school, and people I'd met recently in Nashville.  Nobody knew where the meeting was being held, and everyone had come from far away, some on foot--so everyone was exhausted from having walked all over, all day, searching for the meeting spot.  As usual I really had to go to the bathroom, so I set off to find one,but I kept being apprehended by groups of people still uncertain of the meeting site.  Some people in each group were so fatigued from walking all day that I had to help prop them up as we walked together to the meeting area. Finally, everyone was gathered--I still hadn't gone to the bathroom--and people took their seats around a 60- or 70-foot long folding table to take some sort of IQ test.  A motherly woman was walking around passing out the test, which consisted of a fold-out card kind of like the ones with season stats and game dates that you get at sporting events.  Only this was some sort of "emotional IQ test" that featured incomplete sentences--you had to fill in words indicated by dashes, kind of like a  cloze reading passage  (but different because the precise number of letters was indicated by the dashes).  However, you then also had to complete the sentence in an "emotionally appropriate" way.  I thought it was a stupid, biased test, and thought about demanding to see how it had been tested for reliability and validity, but I began completing it anyway.  "Get started on this right away, sweetheart," the motherly woman said to me as she passed by again.    But I still really had to go to the bathroom.  In the restroom, sick people on strange gurneys lay in each of the stalls, and nurses in crisp white old-school uniforms kept coming by to check on them.    I raced back to the table from the restroom to complete the test.  But a proctor was calling out last names so that we could turn our papers in.  "Bellos," she called.  "Numbers 179 and 180."  Supposedly  we had gotten two subsequently-numbered test cards at the beginning of the administration.  I tried to explain that I hadn't, but head proctor wasn't buying it.  We went out into the night to track down the woman who had handed me my tickets.  "Oh, I did the same thing yesterday," she said, chuckling when we discovered that she had given me two arbitrarily numbered tickets.  "Just kidding," she said as she walked away.    Back in the meeting hall people were already lined up to turn in their tickets.  I was still angry we had had to take such an arbitrary test without any explanation of its purpose.  But I had other, more immediate concerns--people I had known only in passing from high school were coming up to me and asking when we would be able to squeeze in that midnight visit to Denny's.   
3132 20030706231211 you say divinity, i say infinity   In a school building, Tara McGrath and others from my high school were scrambling to get in the doors in time for class.  Earlier, though, I'd driven down mountain passes and past the sunny woods of a national park.  From the car I glimpsed a short furry animal running alongside our car--a tapir with a shortened snout and tusks sprouting from beside its jaws.  It kept up with our car on its squat legs, its body taut as though made entirely of muscle.  Its fur was stiff and wiry and its fangs gleamed.  It dropped off, tired of running without the promise of a meal.  Then I glimpsed two miniature deer--a tiny mother and an even smaller fawn.  Then another tapir, running through the woods after glimpsing us.  Then, in the cool early morning shadow of the oak-leaf covered forest floor, a black musk ox snoozing away.   On the way into the school building, carloads of elegant women from Africa greeted me, asking me if I knew where they were supposed to go for their workshop series.  I ran through the hallway, but got suckered into waiting for the elevator rather than taking the fire escape stairway up to class. Inside, I looked everywhere for the set of books I had deliberately left in the classroom so that I could get right to work when I came in.  I couldn't find them, and I'd left my glasses behind.    The first math warm-ups were on the board.  There were three in all, and the point was to hve everyone on your team--there were two teams in all--solve the warm-ups independently and correctly.  The first problem listed nothing more than the name of a contemporary rap or hip-hop song. We had to identify the artist, then draw the graph and write the equation associated with the song.  THe first one was easy--the equation and graph of a circle.  I don't remember the artist or the tune though. The problems began to get harder, not only because I didn't recognize any of the song titles, but also because I'd forgotten the generalized formulas for a parabola, hyperbola, etc.  I was stuck on a song title I thought was from L'il Kim--I couldn't figure out what equation went with it.    The second warm-up was making tiny balls the size of smoke bombs out of the orange plastic netting four pound bags of oranges sometimes come in. The last problem was tricky--I thought I had solved it, but I had read the instructions incorrectly.  I had thought that I was supposed to take half-centimeter wooden cubes and arrange them in 3 x 3 squares, into a square made up of 36 3 x 3 squares in all.  But in reality I was supposed to have spelled out a word in which all the letters were the same height and width, all composed out of the tiny wooden cubes, but in which each letter was composed of a different, regularly increasing number of blocks.  My job was to figure out the factor by which to increase the number of wooden cubes in each letter, and then spell out the word with the blocks. Slowly I realized I was being held in the classroom infinitely by this task, like  Kay in the palace of the Snow Queen , trying to spell out "eternity" in pieces of ice.   
3139 20060126074407 Hanging out with Matthew Neal and his new wife's six-year-old (or thereabouts) indeterminate gender child.  We were romping about in the old attic of their big old house, actually Matthew's wife's family's ancestral home.  There was a special window on the top floor through which you could see a wooden porch swing perched high in the treetops, rocking back and forth vigorously as though it werein a storm.  The colors behind this window were vibrant blue and green like in old photographs from the 50s and 60s.  That's why it was called the "Kodachrome window".  Matthew and son had to leave to take a plane out of state (to Alabama?), so I went out with them.  Back at my mom and dad's, my mom was complaining that the little girl (also Matthew's child, the same one?) had left a full pot of pasta out in the backyard, "by the beach where she always likes to sit."  I had no idea where this beach could be but I went out anyway to get it.  I walked up by the compost pile and I could hear rustling underground, as though from many scurrying rodents.  Rats, I though, and got prepared to dart away should one -- or more -- appear.  But only a quirrel emerged, and seeing me, ran haphazardly, confused and scared,until it reached a tree.  Then another emerged, and another, all from beneath the heap.  Then, the woods were filled with the sounds of squirrels dropping from trees onto the ground.  When they dropped they would turn belly-up and freeze, possum-like.  The sound of them dropping was like the first sounds of heavy rainfall when you are in the woods in summer canopied with leaves, a dull thump that prefigured something more vigorous and drenching.  I was terrified, running back to the front of the house, where the quirrels were continuing to drop like black walnuts from the trees.  I was running between falling squirrels.  I had gotten tothe front and had a clear path I could run between the spreading canopy of two trees when I realized that Ihad left the pasta pot out back.  There was no choice but to go get it.  Franne Lee and the chalkboard full of writing.  I went to the vending machine to purchase stamps but it was the "Archer Novelty" vending machine, which vended only vintage stamps.  The machine was right on the street corner of a quiet city street.  You put in your coins and twisted the knob and dealt with the luck of the draw.  I was buying 5-cent and tweny-seven-cent stamps from the machine.  Many of these stamps were actually advertisements of some sort, like the series of "Udderly Wonderful!" bovine milking care cream stamps.  There were some tiny red five-cent stamps with the face of a man on them; these came in tiny, dark blue envelopes.  I read the disclaimer on the bottom of the vending machine more carefully.  "Contact Archer for mailing dispensation," it said.  I was mad!  I had planned to use these stamps to mail some things right then.  My dad, to Sarah, who was pouring half and half into her coffee: "I hope you realize how much sugar is already in that half and half."  Then, less sternly: "Try it without some extra sugar one time and see how you like it."  
3173 20060529184008 This morning -- in the cafe and bookshop and business run by the precocious and worldly children of the alternative high school (we see documentary footage of one who, even at the tender age of five years, is already sewing her own deconstructed clothing, sweetly proclaiming as she sashays around in flowerprint legging, a camo jacket, and a twirly, almost too-short mini-skirt, "if they don't like it, they don't have to buy it, but i think they'll still like me".  she says something about lucid dreaming too.)  the shop is completely run by the students, though adult-age advisors are available for guidance. it has gone through many incarnations and some visitors are worried that it is in a period of decline but i have reason to believe that it is in a period of transition -- perhaps moving from a shop to something else. two older radical dykes come in the bookshop section and are disappointed by the selection of feminist literature.  they are in the process of badmouthing the store but i am turning away, distracted by the current student, a teenaged girl who seems just accepting of their complaints.  on the one hand i feel her response is not assertive enough, that she should do more to assuage these women's fears about the quality of the store, but on the other hand i admire her attitude, which is accepting -- there is no other word for it.  she is reserving judgement and is not defensive.  she doesn't seem too cool for school, either -- but rather that she is truly taking in what is said.  i turn to the complaining women and ask them what they think, specifically, is missing.  i truly want to know and explain that i have not read much in this area and would like to know both where to begin and where to head. then, just as one of the women is about to speak (she is the only one who has spoken really, the woman who i have been assuming is her partner has been silent all this time), i am woken up in real life to go for a walk.  i am, in real life (but still in the half-dazed state you get when you wake up but still think your dream might be real), very disappointed not to have learned what the books would be.  This afternoon -- in our house but it is my nanny's old house mapped on top of it.  katherine dunn is there and danielle sered too.  i am trying to prepare the music for doriet's wedding.  everything is kind of hectic, but suddenly i realize that sean keane is coming in from japan for a special event.  i go towards the door with our new camera.  will is there and kevin and others, in an entryway that seems like a convenience store aisle stocked with consumer goods.  sean is knocking repeatedly at the door, which is still locked from the inside.  we are laughing, shouting at him to come in, while will and others pose cameras in order to get a good shot of him surprised to see us all.  i am trying to figure how to open the door without him seeing me so that i can get video footage of him coming down the aisle of the foyer and getting surprised.  i open the door just slightly -- it starts swinging open slowly towards the inside.  i run away fast and duck behind the other side of the shelving to film. 
3174 20060906131210 In the bathroom at the school where I had just left my old philosophy teaher William Edelglass, snakes dropping off rafters in the ceiling and some lesson I had desperately to learn, some letter I had written not to receive a response but to make facts known, taking leave of the room forever with the knowledge of the room inside of me, thinking of black snakes coiled in rafters and waiting.  In the bathroom I went into one stall and was about to put toilet paper on the seat when I looked down to see the bowl overflowing with nothing more than clear water, but hundreds of mosquitoes trapped and drowned within it, more mosquitoes coming.  In the Blamey's driveway, making turkey calls, which summoned not turkeys but a robin, a curlew, a quail, a chachalaca, whose common name I could not, at that point, recall.  There were tigers on the loose, I growled in a low cat meow to my parents' cat Jack, to warn him to go up a new euonymus tree that had sprouted along the border of Chuck's lawn and the Blamey's.  Jack would not go and while the tiger stalked behind him I lifted him up and placed him in the tree, but at the same time the tiger pounced and they were running across the field, Jack for dear life and the tiger for a kill.  I got Jack up in the tree somehow, reversing time, and thought that if I needed to climb up a tree myself perhaps I could still get up the dead euonymus, and wondered whether it would hold any protection against a tiger.  In the woods I could see the tiger's half-grown cub, and I walked out into the driveway, explaining that, while I liked big cats, the tiger made me nervous.  Ifound out it had not one but four little ones, the three smallest at an age where they still could bepetted, though the woods did not permit them to be raised as normal, but rather to scatter and fend for themselves.  As I left, having learned that Alicia Weinstein had the math teacher's son's workbook (for this the poor boy would probably get a suspension from his school, though the mistaken swap of workbooks was not his fault) -- having heard this I was for some reason eager to walk with Alicia, going so far as to blow off Paul Staudt, who stood in the back of a car with a beautiful acoustic guitar, about to askif I would play in a quartet.    I drove on -- a truck onthe railroad tracks, shining a beam of light through the night that at first Ithought were theheadlights of an oncoming train.  I was late to the calculus exam for which I had not studied, for the class in which I had taken none of the other exams that semester, not even the one, for example, which Alicia held in her folder with all Mr. Kulik's notes and suggestions of what to study based on her patterns of error.  At the curve of the road which became the road through Mount SInai schools, but linking one pool of blackness to another, I stopped suddenly and sang to myself thelyrics of Will Oldham's song:    Even if love were not what I wanted  Love would make love the thing most desired.    I sang this over and over and something in the field beyond glowed until I relaized that I was stopped in the middle of the curve late for my calculus test.  
3176 20030814100807 My childhood friend Aisling and her mom Nina had walked in through the front door.  Aisling was much shorter than I had expected her to turn out--I think that she was even shorter than me.  We went together to a show in a local bar.  The band turned out to be my Uncle James' band.  I was there with my sisters and we were all trying to get out of the bar so that we could get home.  I was swimming in a giant pool that stretched from one end of a large hotel complex to another.  The pool was fed by the sea and went up and down with the tides.  In Plaza art supply store, things were closing up for the day.  It was Saturday and they had just held a painting workshop.  I walked inside because I needed to use the bathroom.  They had remodeled the bathroom area.  When I came out, I saw that photos we had taken of various pieces of art had all been developed.  I took them and went over, in my head, the mental list of images we needed so I could be sure we had everything required.  A woman was standing near me pointing out the names of other images we had been meant to take pictures of--all the artwork was work friends of ours, mostly from back home in NY, had done.    We hadn't taken a picture of this one hand-calligraphed alphabet by Wells Tipley, but I had my version of it in front of me.  I had done it underwater with a strange pen.  The letters looked spidery and bushy and oddly like Japanese kanji.  I knew I needed to practice calligraphy every day if I wanted to get better.  Then the scene shifted entirely.  I saw massive armies of beasts, walking upright on two legs but with horrible rams' heads and hairy chests with the entrails spilling out--all marching out of the edge of the now-lake that fed the swimming pool.  They were chasing livestock before them, devouring those they caught as they marched in lockstep, burning the grass they walked on.  Behind them, as they marched, their company in the back turned into a giant octopus, forty or fifty feet long, rearing up behind the troops.  Then I was watching a movie, but I was inside it.  The view shifted up to the sky, where a fine mesh seemed spread across the clouds and the week sun.  Everything was grainy.  In the corner of the screen you could see the octopus's tentacles waving furiously.  The camera panned down and i glimpsed two men walking along, hurrying through the desert with their single horse.  I glimpsed them again, lost; then a bird's-eye view of them without the horse, tracing and retracing their steps on a desert island.  And then finally I spotted them, one man with a giant block of ice on his back--about the size of an upright deep freezer.  The two men were hurrying from a village, back intot he dunes of the unihabited part of the island.  They I saw the elders of the village filing out; something had been stolen from them.  They glimpsed the two men and realized that one--the man not carrying the ice--had been a member of a neighboring tribe who had come and tricked them before.  They shot arrows after him, but he was unhurt--he deflected them with his wrists and torso.  The octopus, somewhere, was still waiting by the edge of the shore. 
3181 20060310093008 When the man who was the main figure of the horror movie we had somehow committed ourselves to watch kidnapped people, they were immediately thrust into a jungle and told to shoot each living thing.  Each living thing, they were told, was out to get them, and they must follow orders if they wanted to survive.  In fact, we ourselves were thrust into the jungle, with one dirt road cut through the center of it, and a child who wandered out wating a piece of watermelon.  I, watching the movie, saw the character shoot the boy and him collapse to the ground like a bird. But then moments later he rose up again, swaying as he rose like one of those jointed toys that collapses when you press a button only to rise up again whole.  He was still eating his watermelon but this innocent action seemed more sinister now.  From the jungle around him came other child figures.  Our main character was trying to reach the main road now, shooting into the gathering crowd of children, but it did no good. They swarmed him and he was taken to the compound deep inside the jungle.  But then once there, inside the cinderblock walled compound where the man in the wheelchair was wheeling around the swarms of unkempt children housed there, it was me myself who was the main character, still instructed to shoot and kill whatever I saw.  But watching the children, and looking at other characters shootign at them without any apparent ill effects, I began to suspect a more sinister plot, and I realized that the children would not kill me.  The man in the wheelchair, dressed in yellow, rode back and forth the long hall that was the main portion of the compound. Slowly the pieces began to put themselves together.  I found one girl who looked like a girl who had been in a class I had observed many years ago. She was pudgy and above average height, with a chin length brown bob.  "So how is it that you ended up here?" I asked. As she answered she held her two arms out in front of me, wrists joined together.  "Our founder - "  "The man in the wheelchair," I interrupted -   "The man inthe wheelchair wanted to start a children's home in Hauppauge.  So he built this place and brought us all here."  I was thinking out loud.  "But you are trapped here."  She was nodding yes.  "And he lost his legs in an accident, but he wants one of you to travel back in time to avert the accident that caused this.  And him bringing in people to shoot at you is partially a way of keeping you scared, partially a way of keeping you to the compound, and partially a way of determining who is capable of being wounded, because this will be the person who can travel back in time.  And," -- here I looked back at the man in the wheelchair -- "he is a hemophiliac.  So he relies on you all for a steady stream of blood."  The girl nodded, not so much surprised that I had figured out what was going on, but relievedthat someone knew.  Holding out her arms again, she said, "Hard to imagine, but he takes out two-thirds of our blood each day."  I had figured out the plot of the movie, but this meant too that I had to go after the real villian, the man in the wheelchair, and capture him.  
3197 20030303063207 Unlike Kurosawa I make bad films   I was driving through a "bad " section of town, doing research for a newspaper article.  I stopped at an intersection and felt fear for the first time driving--the driver of the car in front of me had a mid-sized handgun held out the side of his window.  I gave him wide berth rather than pulling up right behind him.  When the light changed in our favor, the car pulled out into the intersection and rapidly changed lanes.  This was apparently his motivation for holding out the gun--so no one would cut him off.  I walked/drove through several shopping centers' entrance ways.   I ended up in a WalMartin a better maintained section of town.  Little girls' Easter tights were on sale on a little rack, and for some reason I was looking through them trying to find stuffed toy animals.  But all I kept finding were bargain bags of womens' WalMart designer clothes.  Two larger women about my age were looking through the clothing racks trying to find professional dress.  I realized they were Andrea and Corie from my high school.  On my way out of the store I tapped Corie on the shoulder and said goodbye.  She acknowledged me with a nod; Andrea turned to me and said, "Goodbye, Rachel."   Walking back through the numerous store entrances I tried to puzzle out why Andrea had called me Rachel--I didn't look like a Rachel, I decided, but in all it wasn't a bad name.  I thought of the cousins I had named Rachel and of their parents' motivations for naming them that.  Suddenly I was in an unfamiliar room with my sisters, Rick, and Brandon.  My mom was in the other room sleeping.  We were talking about something  and suddenly I jumped in with my idea for a journal in which I recorded exactly the way I felt at any given moment.  The conversational connection which I used to slip in this statement was slight, yet I went on to describe how in this journal/log book I would record how I felt physically, how my heart felt, what I was thinking, at various time intervals throughout the day.  "This will help me to understand patterns in my behavior," I said.  I walked in to where my mom was sleeping in an enormous bed in a hotel room.  She had been sleeping for just an hour and I asked her when she wanted to wake up.  She wanted to sleep for five hours total, she said--she slept for so few hours that she was glad for whatever sleep she could get.  She was amazed that she'd slept for an hour.  Rick, Brandon and I were walking along a road that looked like Shore Road East.  I was looking at a schedule of movies and I saw that one called  Isueh  was playing.  I was about to recommend that we go see it--I had never seen it, but I knew that it had gotten a lot of critical acclaim--when suddenly Brandon piped up and started talking about how it had come about that he'd  wound up filming that movie rather than another he was working on.  Then I realized that Brandon had made that movie when he was fiteeen, and I was embarrassed that I hadn't realized that sooner.  Much, much later, in another dream, I saw a horrible video clip of a burly man, a woman, and their tiny dirty blond haired daughter all wearing   smocks   of meat.  
3202 20060720080808 In building with eseentially the same layout as the end of MS Elementary once the kindergarten classes had been turned to administrative offices. I was having some sort of forced jollity with Ms. Servellon and other Landrum employees.  I was being asked to wear a Santa hat but eventually I managed to pawn it off.  Amy Weidner was sitting next to me but was occassionally someone else.  Mrs. Vela was there.  At some point we looked though photos of former students.  Someone pointed out Adan, said "There's an orphan boy we took care of."People came in tot he room, shaped like a gym, actually a gym -- earlier the kindergarteners had been doing a skit that was a remake of a mobil phone ad -- people played duck-duck-goose around a circular "cell tower" of other kids to demonstrate how one cell phone had faster response than another ... but also to say if you didn't mind a longer response time, you could just take "another walk around the block" (another walk wround the duck-duck-goose circle).  Kerri Scroope came in the room dressed like beautiful Indian corn, in all shades of blue and purple and mauve.  She was talking about some restaurant that I didn't want to go to.  We walked out into the dark hallway.  Someone mentioned that it was 3 o'clock and I asked if it was true -- yes, it was ten minutes to 3 p.m. I didn't understand how the time had passed so quickly from 10 a.m.  I had to go to an orchestra concert, the last of the season.  I was gathering my music -- I had many extra copies of music from previous concerts that I had never returned: Delibes' Sylvia, a piece with a ripped informative back like a record jacket, just called Pelleas, by someone with a difficult and harsh looking name, a set of Bach concertos, others.  Someone, my sister, holding up a needle, asked, "When will Aunt Mary start sewing?"  In the hallway, walking back to get my viola, I was trying to throw out my bag of stuff (food scraps and the like).  A woman was sweeping up refuse and some of my trash fell to the floor.  I picked it up, saving the receipts.  THere was a receipt from somewhere on Highway 77 in the valley.  I held on to a bag of sample food and spoke with the woman, asking her about her day.  She walked along with me.  Earlier Les had been trying to print out resumes and envelopes on eleven new printers his dad had gotten, but the CIA had called to take them back.  Les didn't want to go back to his dad's house alone to pick up his backpack.  Back int he hallway the woman told me how she was going to sue the company she worked for, this same printer reseller, because they were acting unethically and cheating people out of money.  I was crying because she was doing the right thing even though it would be dangerous for her.  Another woman came up, Camille Terranova's mom, and I asked where Camille was -- she said "On the floor with medicine".  I thought she meant drugged up, so I said "poor thing," but then realized that she probably meant on the third floor administering medicine.  THey were tlaking about the woman's suit and my reaction to it.  I was a bout to get a report card.  When was the last time I had been to French class, I wondered.    
3225 20050817105408 I thought I didn't remember the dream, because the Punch-and-Judy dialogue of "yeah?"  "oh yeah."  "yeah?"  "oh yeah." that had woken me up, later than I was supposed to wake, kept ringing in my ears.      But then I remembered:    First, with my family at an indoor-outdoor gathering.  I have to leave. I have my drink in a fancy glass and I don't know where to put it.  Rick keeps telling me to leave it in this specific spot,; my cousin Rachel will come and get it.  But I put it on a table and indeed, my cousin Rachel comes over and puts it in the spot where Rick had told me to put it.   I have a fancy dress on and my Nanny keeps making comments about it. "How fancy!" she says, tugging on it.  "Does it have a hustle?", and I know this means "a built-in girdle".  It doesn't.  "Today's medium is yesterday's large," my nanny says to her friend.  "Who knows what size a hostess of the sixties would wear today."   We are in Chicago.  I am not sure how I know this, but it is somewhere urban that is not New York or on the West Coast.  It is dark and we are at a bar.  Up on the wall -- some arcane explanation of the musical acts -- they do "plainclothes chanting and full-voiced singing in the old style".  They had a laminated print of Jay Ryan's as their menu -- Rick and I are excited by this.  They have different prices for the evening depending on whether you have a good voice or not -- also if you can draw well.  Turns out, however, that they are not singing medieval tunes tonight but reading books.  Everyone at the bar gets a copy of a book and everyone is silent reading.  Our friends Christine and Alllen are next to us.   They are reading too.  The book we get is wonderful -- beautiful pictures and an unusual story.  I am so happy and excited by the idea of getting to read uninterrupted.  Occassionally the barkeep will ask us all questions or point us to a particular passage he will read aloud.  We get another book only five or ten minutes later; this one is about orphans who live in a house, and the stories are all interconnected with tiny line drawings colored with watercolor.  These are all stories for adults, but very childlike on some level -- the drawings and the freshness of the ideas and the personal-ness of them. These are not stories for a large audience but rather for just such a venue as this, in a bar with friends, all of you more or less on the same page.  "Why doesn't Nashville have anything like this?" I think to myself, and get kind of sad that we have to leave pretty soon.  The next book is a book of French pastoral poetry, and the next "Stories and Fantasies", a series of short prose pieces by a Polish author of WWI era.  But my copy is all transliterated back into Russian in blue handwritten script in the margins and above each line.  It is almost impossible to read -- and it seems to be neither in Russian nor English, when I examine it closely.  "Devoshka" is the one word I can just make out that actually seems to be Russian.  I ask Rick what language it is in and he says "Proto-English".  But I do not think that is the case. Further on, though, shorter poem-pieces are printed all in English,a nd there is nary a margin note to be seen. 
3227 20060602095807 We drove through the side entrance to an amusement park that was really the site of an old industrial complex.  As we drove in we could see the abandoned Greek cottages, roofless; beyond the spit of land jutting into the Aegean sea.  I wanted to get off the bus and take photos inside the houses but instead asked RIck if he thought it was possible to sneak back in later.  He said he thought it might work but I was already looking back to figure out how to get to this point again.  We passed the hordes of people on the old reclaimed trolley and freight trian lines.  The place had been Disneyfied.  Inside the dollar store I was trying to decide if I needed anything but I didn't really -- not multicolored loofahs, not clothespins, not even the homemade crepes someone was just storing in the last case of the freezer.  My uncle Mike was int he next room and had come up to let me know that I needed to come downstairs for an interview in a little bit.  I felt self-conscious because I had not put on deodorant or shaved my legs, and Uncle Mike had adonished another lady, younger than me, for having smelly armpits.  Ben Vitualla had invited his friends over to celebrate and now they would not leave.  I had parked my car where the orchestra was rehearsing, on another portion of the Greek amusement park.  There were people (from orchestra?) who were supposed to watch the building each day during the summer since no one was using it.  I saw two of them as I came in -- one had shown up by accident thinking the other could not make it.  I was walking along an overflowing culvert bordered by rocks.  There was no choice but to get wet at some point because it had overflowed to flood the ground.  Kids were trying to gain access into the building by going around the deeper part of the culvert that served as a moat.  One group of boys was trying to climb behind a stone wall -- this was all underground in this cave-like overhang -- but as they went around the wall it started pivoting and swinging froma single point of contact on the rock ceiling.  I was concerned for the kids and pulled them back from the wall and told them to go a different way.  The wall was gyrating and folding up and down.  Inside it was Doriet's wedding and also my parents' downstairs room. The wedding procession was beginning.  The music was playing but no one was moving so finally I stage-whispered to the wedding party in the bathroom "come on!"  The two guys in front were walking very fast and I told them to slow down and walk in time to the music, but they were already where they were supposed to be.  The women and children were walking in time.  I went outside to practice my song becuase I hadn't started learning it yet.  Aunt Barbara joined me.  She had a cello and I asked if she wanted to accompany me.  So we started playing together and it sounded really nice but Aunt Barbara kept interrupting the practice to talk about other things.  I was getting pretty nervous about how we would sound and I kept just trying to practice my part, but it sounded really thin with just one instrument.  My mom had a whole page of doubts -- some funny, some serious -- written out in response to a question from Sam.  
3242 20060321111208 Inside a dream-version of Harry and Amy's bathroom, where I was putting on my clothes for an orchestra performance.  I wasn't actually sure where the clothes were or if I even had all of them.  I had been carrying piles of clothes for my mom and others past see through columns with shelving units inside of them.  The bathroom was spacious and well lit with natural light, but there were several big piles of clothes in the corner.  I was looking through them for my long black dress with golden starbursts at the bottom.  Simultaneously, or before? -- looking through the magazine to light upon the article about Nick E. and Neko C.  I was so excited when I recognized Neko Case in the cartoon illustrating the top right of the article, in which she leaned against the side of her touring van.  Then, while I sat on top of a wooded hill, I saw that Neko herself was ascending the hill.  (Here there were strange monorails, made of glass and metal, and the sky behind us was all golden from the setting sun.)  Back in the bathroom, I was finding my clothes with just a few minutes to spare before I had to leave.  Doriet was there, talking about her upcoming wedding and looking for her pair of flip-flops with the sky-blue flower between the toes.  She did not want to have to wear her brown pair if she didn't have to.  I had to wash my armpits and so I went to the one of the sinks, where I found "Father of the House" soap in a handy pump dispenser.  On the outside there was a funny engraving of a Victorian dad lounging in a recliner.  This soap had been a gift from Leslie to her dad Harry.  I took just a little bit to use and was washing under my arms when Harry started coming into the room -- then realized I was in there and left hurriedly.  I felt bad for using his towel accidentally and so I decided to let myself air dry.  Sarah, our mom and I set off walking to get to a wedding (my wedding? or Sarah's? unclear).  The landscape turned into south-west Texas mesquite scrub, and we walked for a while higher and higher up a gently sloping hill.  But then at the top there was a road into the scrub and we took it, I following my mom becuase I thought she knew the way.  But the road became a wide gravel path through thicker and thicker scrub, almost a forest, and I grew concerned.    "Mom, I thought you knew the way," I said.    "I was just following you," my mom said.  But then we saw an old family friend of Rosalie's, together with another woman in bright pastel colors associated with older women's clothes at Easter, and I realized they was headed to the wedding, too. Indeed we went a few steps further and realized we were in an alcove of the chapel.  This was an old catholic church, one of the first missions. Andrea from the kempleton wiki was the one getting married, and she was running around, quite nervous.  I was praying for her to be less nervous.  The ceremony began, and she lit candles on the altar (we were sitting behind it, to the congregation's front right, rather like a jury box).  The candles flickered and all went out, or were all burning at once, to the wick -- the two states were mixed somehow.  Everyone besides me was dressed in the bright Jordan almond colors of Easter. 
3246 20030130080007 Don't Call Me Shorty   This is right in the middle of things, but, alas, it is all I remember.  I was playing viola and the second string kept getting thinner and thinner.  I knew it was going to break and it did.  My childhood friend Laura was about to come over; I had grown old, with two or three double chins, horrible bumpy pimply skin, and white hair all down one side of my head.  I had grown downy white skin all over the sides of my face; it was so long that I was trying to cut it off with scissors.  Rick came by the room I was standing in, which was my old room in my parents' house (except one wall had been partially destroyed by fire; you could see the pattern of flames that had eaten away the plywood siding).  Rick made me mad; I don't know what happened, only that I had a childlike reaction to whatever he did, petulant and pouty.  He tried to apologize and I wouldn't let him.  I had decided that I would go to the music store with my friend Laura to buy a set of replacement strings. Downstairs, my mom asked me if I'd brushed my teeth, and waved her hands in front of her nose when I told her I had.  "Well, we know you need to go to the meat market," she said; I understood my mom to mean that I had to go to the dentist, but I thought she was being kind of rude about it.  My sister Sarah was making crazy photo collages in an art class she was taking with my mom as the instructor.  They were underneath slabs of glass on the kitchen table. There was one which had, in the lower right hand corner, a photo of my Nanny holding my sister Sarah; Sarah herself, in her nanny's lap was holding a smaller version of herself, and so on to infinity.  In the upper left hand corner my mom had made some further suggestions to the collage: my Uncle Mike had apparently kept a timeline of significant milestones and events in Sassy's life, and my mom thought Sarah should include the actual handwritten timeline.  We were standing outside a large house by the harbor; in fact, it was a street of houses abutting the harbor.  I was standing with my mom in front of the last house on the street.  My mom was making fun of me because I was short.  I got very upset and threw a big cup of water on a man in a suit sitting beneath a tree on a grassy knoll between the last house on the block and the one next to it.  My mom and the man began chasing me--I wanted to run quickly, but I couldn't.  When we'd run--only a short distance--we came across the people next door getting ready for a party.  I agreed to help them--they were aksing for paper plates, and I explained that we had left all our paper goods in Harlingen for the next occupant of our house.  Men with mullet hairstyles, people from the Untitled group, trendy people were walking in and out of the house.  I was helping a lady wipe off paper plates using these old terrycloth bathing suits as rags.  The plates themselves were covered in satin or in velvet or terrycloth, in deep jewel colors.  Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sisters were standing on the lawn in front of us smoking in late afternoon sunlight.  The woman I was working with and I were trying to get the plates done quickly; the party was about to begin and we had a lot to do to get ready.   
3259 20060201084207 In the darkened board room with freestanding triangular displays like those seen in museums or shopping malls, each with different beautiful woodcut images, I was shouting too loudly about our upcoming fieldtrip to Clarksville, both because I had imbibed too much coffee, and because I was angry about some executive decisions.  I realized that I was not letting go of responsibility gracefully.  I was drinking out of a large recycled wooden cup, designed to look like styrofoam, that Adam Welch had designed for a smoothie bar up in the North Country.  It had a beautiful carved image on the front, also kind of like a wood block, and patches of equations that would appear and disappear.  I was incredibly late for high school math class -- in fact, I had forgotten my entire afternoon schedule, it was so long since I had gone to any classes.  Before I could enter the class, which was tucked in the end of the hallway, I had to wait until the special needs class filed back into their own classroom, just next door.  They were singing loudly as they walked through the hallway.  Inside the crazy math teacher was scrawling equations all across the board, strange derivations of the inverse functions of the inverse functions of trigonometry.     "For those that are taking notes, this should appear as page four," she said.  In fact I did have a notebook, the same ntoebook I carried around with me all the time (in this particular dream).  My notes were written in it from the back forwards.  I was working on a problem of making one into two by a series of arithmetical manipulations.  The math teacher was sitting in the desk next to me, eating.  The woman next to me asked her, "Have YOU actually derived all these formulas?" The teacher just passed us a glass canister of opalescent liquid and a spoon.  "Licao de caco," she said, "juice de coconut.  You try it."  It was somewhat sweet and filmy.  I passed it to the girl who had asked the question but she waved her hand at it and passed it back to the teacher. The teacher was scraping the stringy flesh out of a fermented coconut, its flesh no longer white but a mushy brown and coral pink.  This was a great delicacy and she encouraged us all to try it. Small children gathered around her desk to do so, notably my old student Tony Trejo and other children whose moms had made them traditional indigenous dishes, and I tried it too.  I had a whole additional year of high school to sit through.  I realized that I hadn't gone to English class the entire year, and wondered if it might be worthwhile to do that next year, just so that I could write in class.  Mostly I was just dejected by the fact that I would have to spend one year doing nothing of value.  Inwardly I berated myself for not having organized things so that I could graduate early.  There was an electronic attachment that you plugged into a seat in order to have the music come out of speakers, but I couldn't attach it correctly.  Brett (not his real name but I cannot remember it ;-(  from high school gave me his number.  My mom helped me attach the speaker clamps.  Small children from the Guatemalan highlands were being let out of school, outside. Two small boys were in a cardboard house they had made.  
3261 20060624081008 Of course I had forgotten all my calculus, and there I was with Laura Sobik and others attending class without any real knowledge of what I was doing.  I knew that I had to get to a solo performance evaluation (a la NYSSMA), and that my original sign-up time was 6:30 a.m.  I had signed up to reschedule, but now I was reconsidering, thinking htat would be a good time after all.    I left where Alicia Weinstein and Sari Miniman were tlaking to me and started running to get to the solo performance.  Sari Miniman had been talking kind of in a drone and she was very difficult to understand.  I was in an auditorium and also on a bus heading out weat, with lots of other people on it.  The tour guide was explaining the outside scenery. We were driving through gardens.  Old video footage visible on a screen before us suddenly swept to the long expanse of railway track, desert and scrub on either side.  William Burroughs, another man, a woman who looked like Madonna but also Anjelica Houston were walking down the track.  They were givingthe history of the area, once a haven for junkies and prostitutes, but also for visiting business men looking for a good time.  "And to your right you see rhubarb and coffee ..."  Ah, I realized -- the coffee grew from thrown-away grounds, the rhubarb from tossed-away pie.  "Ladies and gentleman, commentary from ... Our new president ..."  A man with wild, half-empty light blue-green eyes broke through the wall of Burroughs-other man-Madonna.  This man with the light eyes was also some celebrity but I wasn't sure who -- almost like Kyle MacLachlan, except with strange haunted eyes.  I looked out the window to spot the rhubarb.  At first I thought I saw it but it was just a grove of flimsy-stalked plants like jewelweed.  Then I saw huge stumps of plants, overgrown rhubarb.  Alina Opreanu came over to me, talking about how she and her friends had not had time for all their errands, including getting a manicure.  I was pointing out the coffee tree to her.  Somehow beans were ripening to brown in the top branches.  She talked about how nice it was to get a manicure because you got a hand massage.  I was rubbing her earlobe to relax her but I stopped because it seemed to make her uncomfortable.  We were riding the train past the new symphony center and Alina was talking about their friend int he second violin section who always was getting chastised and picked on by the conductor.  We rode by th symphony performing.  People int eh audience were chuckling about some move onthe conductor's part, but it was kind of a classical music in-joke that I didn't understand. We got off the bus as the piece was ending.  Everyone clapped intensely, then suddenly the applause petered out.  There was a large man who was my partner.  He had all the laundry he had done and he was going to take it home.  I was so grateful to him for this act, and I suddenly felt guilty for having gone gallivanting around trying to understand things. I knew I had to get to my solo performance fast, though, if only just to see if my evaluator, Marie Galdi, was even there.   the old sets of tracks in Nashville, other locations: railway lines running across cleared fields and disappearing unused into woods.  
3263 20060129105007 We drove through the old downtown of Albany: towering buildings like an old industrial city.  Passing by the Lithuanian church we saw, on banners hung above the alcoves for the wooden statues of saints, a celebration for "Saint Bellos Day".  I nudged my sisters to point out that truly our name was Lithuanian.  Rounding the corner our name appeared again, and beneath it "Colosanto", and my sisters and I knew this was because our parents' old friends the Colosantos also were trueLithuanians.  This made us proud for some reason.    Everything seemed familiar: the tiny shops and the barbers and the streeets.  Then I realized that we were in Albany (I hadn't put this together before) and that my dad had just given us a car tour of these same streets yesterday.  Outside in a town square the members of the lost country were marching in their traditional clthes, the robes of the Coptic and Byzantine churches.  Their nation had lived together for thousands of years in Africa but no one had known abouthtem.  Now they were seekign recognition of their homeland as a distinct entity, self-governed and with clear geopolitical boundaries.  There were some very dark-skinned and some very light-skinned people in the group, but they did not have conception of race.  The spiritual leader of the group, whom they called "Bishop", had a papal hat with two points, and a long ivory robe emblazoned with symbols of the Coptic church. His right-hand man had a green vestement with snakes and crosses.  They both carried long wooden staffs and they were marching their people through the square to protest non-violently not yet having attained autonomy and recognition of their nationhood. Policemen were harrassing them and shouting racial epithets.  To the bishop and his right hand man , walking to the back and right of the group just for this moment, the policemen said, "You know how these people are".  Then he turned off back to his car.  The right-hand man ran off after him, grabbed him and turned hm around to say in his face, "I'm black."    This had been a movie we were watching in the square.  Now we were assembling a parade procession to an art show my mom was having.  The cars were lining up.  Suddenly someone was shouting on a bullhorn: "The ambulance needs to go next.  Shooter needs to get out of the way. Shooter!  Out of the way!"  The ambulance was racing up to its position in front of the line, but the sharpshooter, in his battered and bulletproof white station wagon, was trying to edge him out to the front of the line, not having heard (or deliberately ignoring) the policeman on the bullhorn.  At the hotel getting dressed for my mom's show, I realized that I had packed the wrong things -- a grey sweater I had cut up to make a v-neck, my paint-stained skin tight tan cargo pants.  I was upset.  I put on some hideous floor-length ivory dress, beaded with iridescent sequins and tube beads.  When I put on the 80s jacket with heavy -duty shoulder pads that went with it, it looked awful.  But when I put my blue camisole on tp it looked okay. But I needed pins because the top was so low.  Katie Neil, too, would come up for the reception, accompanied by her Aunt Jan and her husband, who lived just outside of town.  
3277 20030206082607 I was riding on a bus with one other passenger through a valley ridged on one side by high canyons.  It was late afternoon in winter and the sky was a thin grey-blue wool blanket, worn in some places so the pale sun shone through. We were driving in from another land, full of ravines and high rock passes.  It was the goblin land I dreamed about when I was small.  The canyon we were riding through was the bridge between the two lands.  The other passenger was trying to tell me about his musical preferences but I kept interrupting him.  I didn't want to--I knew it was rude--but we were driving by amazing friezes, some seventy or eighty feet high, carved directly into the canyon walls.  The friezes were carved so as to give the appearance of motion as you passed them.  Or rather, they changed slightly depending on the angle from which you viewed them.  As you approached them, their forms came forward from the cliff face until, when you were directly in front of them, you were looking at 3-dimensional figures almost separate from the cliff wall.  Then, as you passed them, they receded into the wall until they were almost flush with it, only a little low-relief showing.  We were traveling swiftly enough that the impression was of a series of dancers stepping in and out of a line in waves.   The friezes were grouped by theme; each theme extended about the length of a football field.  There were giant heads of caricature, grouped by emotion--a collection of faces of happiness, then a collection of faces of fear, then of surprise.  There were heads of history, and faces of great beauty; there were figures and there was one series of panel representing motion--with shapes carved out of rock to illustrate the rippling of water, the blowing and whistling of wind, the scattering and clumping of sand, the rising of rock, the running and clamboring of animals, the creeping of vegetation.  When we got off the bus I separated from the other passenger but I felt great sadness at doing so.  I felt, too, as though I had failed the other passenger somehow; I felt like I had lost something beautiful that I had been supposed to hold safe.     Somewhere downtown, Rick and some other people and I were walking around in alarge group.  It was some place that seemed, geographicaly, like Elliston Place, but none of the shops were the same.  Four women in semi-professional dress I had never seen before were walking with us.  The women were asking for Mary Carroll but nobody knew where she was.  I kept saying that she had gone to Alabama to check on a ring--two rings, actually--but nobody thought that was the case.  I was trying to describe the ring that she was looking at so that people would believe me--in my dream it was rose gold, with two large leaves coiled like serpents around a purple-red gem.    With the four women I walked through the back entrance to an Italian restaurant.  Inside, the layout was the same as the house my Aunt Mary lived in fourteen years ago, only they had cut the kitchen in half and made a separate dining space.  The owners, who were Middle Eastern, offered us a seat in the kitchen, at the formica table stained with spaghetti-sauce rings. But we needed a table that would sit at least seven more people.  
3286 20030119170008 Wouldn't you believe it--it's just my luck.  No recess.   I'm in high school again.  But it's actually the elementary school that  I taught in recently, mapped onto the geography of my old high school,  with some of my high school teachers thrown in for good measure.    I'm coming back to school after a long vacation somewhere.  A long, long  vacation--so long I have forgotten to prepare for any of the numerous  projects or tests that were due when I returned to school.  In fact, in  my dream I am being compelled to return to high school after the long hiatus of the seven actual years since I have graduated.  In my dream, I  still have had all the experiences I actually have had in those seven  years.   I manage to get to school very late--whether I hitch a ride with my mom or walk, I can't remember.  As I walk into the building, I am trying to remember all the procedures of high school.  Where do I get my books?   Don't I need a pass, since I'm late?  Who are my friends?  What are my classes?  Social studies is first period.  Unfortunate, since I will have to take  a test as soon as I walk in the classroom.  I had gotten out of taking it just before I left for vacation.  We'd been studying "The Globe After  World War I".  Studying is a loose term here, as the teacher, my old  eighth grade teacher, Mr. Conboy, with his fuzzy, squirrel-like monobrow  and forehead furrowed like a lava field, would assign us readings and  leave us to our own devices.  I have not read any of the assigned  readings.  I get a pass from the secretary of the school at which I (actually)   taught for the last two years.  Looking down, I see that it is marked  6:45 am--the time of my arrival at school.  I am 45 minutes late.    But instead of going to class, I am roped into watching and teaching a  group of my former elementary students.  We're in a wood-panelled room  somewhere in the labyrinth of central offices.  The assistant principal  keeps bringing in additional students, until I have about fifteen in my  charge in all, ranging in age from five to eleven years.  I'm suppposed  to teach them something, but goodness knows what.  "Just watch 'em for a  while, would you, Ali?  Just have 'em watch a video or something--you  know what to do," the assistant principal says as she brings the last  group.  I have no idea what to do.  I think I actually wake up at this point and  try to change my dream.  And I can't.  When I return back to sleep the  children are waiting for me, running wild in that wood-panelled room.   My student Brittany has managed to get into the counselor's office and is prank calling me on a rotary telephone.  The counselor is in there,  talking with Brittany, and as I walk over to bring Brittany back into  the room, the counselor mouths something from behind her glass-panelled  office.  I don't ever talk to her face-to-face, but I think what she is  saying is "Organization, Ali.  Organization is the key to success."  For  some reason this makes me very angry.    Brittany remains with the counselor.  I walk back to pick up the rest of  my students.  The wood-panelled room is a mess. All but two students,  Angel and Joe, have fled.  It is 9:45 a.m., and I still don't know  anything about the globe after World War I.    
3290 20030127094207 Suburban Outfitters   My sis Sass, her friend Helen and I had wanted to go into the Salvation Army and check out bicycles, but instead we had wandered inadvertently into Wal-Mart.  We were searching through the racks and at one point, by the inspirational books, I met up with my friend Danielle.  I knocked three shelves over, accidently, and had to replace them.  Urban Outfitters had begun producing clothing "F.W"--for Wal-Mart.  They were mostly big bath-mat like boxy sweaters, and closer-fitting sweater-shirts with horizontally-glued on ribbons.    I went to the bathroom--a dingy, dirty place, with one naked bulb; bare and dark concrete walls, floor, and ceiling; a filthy sink.  I was trying to wash my hands and succeeded mainly in filling up my make-up bag with water.  I was trying to dump it out and all the cap from my eyeliner pencil kept falling off onto the disgusting floor  There were paintbrushes in the bottom of the trash can.   The Greatest Generation   Then I was talking in the bathroom about smallpox vaccinations with Rick and someone else.  Somebody mentioned the possibility that there would be mass panic and that everyone would try to buy plane tickets out of the country were another nation to declare war on the United States.    Treasurebama   Rick and I were driving around a small hilly city.  Were we to find "two of something, doubled up", we would be able to transport ourselves in time.  We were searching on an ancient hill at the edge of town.  Someone else had given us this cryptic message: "It's like finding one thing in Georgia's basement and another in Alabama's attic."  (In my dream I visualized Georgia sitting atop Alabama on the map.)   Rabbit, Run   We were still walking: it was late afternoon in spring, the hour of golden sunset.  In a wooded glen, as we approached, we could see large figures running around.  I thought they were cows at first.  "Javelinas," said Rick.  "Hop up, hop up."   We clambored to a more wooded island in the center of the glen and hid behind trees as the javelinas ran back and forth.  They were the size of cows or maybe adolescent buffalo.  It loked like they were mobbing one of their own gang, but finally, from behind the trees I could make out that two giant,   ground sloth  -sized rabbits were attacking and dispersing the javelinas.  I had moved around too much, watching the fighting rabbits and javelinas, and I'd attracted the attention of one of the rabbits, who came over to the wooded area where we were hidden, ready to attack.  I had to fend it off with karate chops. and I finally immobilized it with blows to the back of its neck.  I was very scared that I had killed it: I didn't want to kill anything, especially not the rabbit, which up close was even more beautiful, soft and powerful-looking at the same time, than it had been at a distance.    "Get your shoes on and run," said Rick.  "That rabbit's gonna wake up any minute."  Indeed, the rabbit was twitching as though it were coming out of a long sleep.  I ran barefoot and didn't put on my shoes until we had gotten into the basement of a strange house that I recognized as my Aunt Kathy and Harvey's.  They'd whitewashed an entire furniture set my Uncle Cecil had made and put it into one whitewashed room.  
3313 20060711084408 from end to beginning, in backwards order:  a) Lisa Rivas is asking if she should go to the Plowhaus meeting or not as she has homework still to finish for class.  Meanwhile I am driving / walking down by a creek that's running along the property.  I tell her she should go but just for an hour, 7:30 - 8:30, if she thinks she can leave and then finish up her work.  She doesn't think she can do this though.  At the meeting I am getting annoyed because I don't see the point in being there.    b) Earlier I am in Zoe's yard.  There is a large insect on the ground -- it's a type of scorpion that you fasten on your recently treated wound atthe hospital.  It locks in place and helps protect your wound.  But this one is out in the open and I don't want to get too close to it because it can sting.  It doesn't look like a scorpion but rather a short insect head kind of like a gold centipede, then a scaly dark brown straigt body of interlocking scales that can slap and curl around something like a snap bracelet.    The insect turns into a beautiful grey cat.  The cat keeps trying to attack me and I climb just high enough in each tree to avoid it being able to swat at me.  I am tired of hovering above the ground and I long to get away but the cat keeps watch over me.  Finally it is moving farther and farther afield in its patrols and I know I must seize the opportunity to jump off the tree and run to the road.  I am doing this, but I run backwards into where Zoe and her caretaker are driving across the grass to Zoe's garage, now at the botto of her property.  "Hello," we all sayto each other.  I have a towels of Zoe's I'm supposed to return and Zoe says to put it in the back studio area.  I go there and meet Zoe and her caretaker ont he way out.  Zoe's hair is wrapped up in a hairnet made of stretchy twine.  I do not know if her caretaker is a relative.  A man comes in the room and is fiddling with the eight-track and cassette holder, a radio station feature, by the door.  He's making it say something about hte Beatles that is unfavorable to Lisa Rivas's tenure as Plowhaus president.  c) I've got lots of photos of the various stops on our visit, including several of the greasy spoon restaurant.  I'm at Bryce's shop (but not his actual shop -- an old house like the Mills Pond House) -- and he's asking me to loan him back various tee-shirts, some of which I don't have.  About the only one I will be able to provide is a white teeshirt with a map of NYC's Little Italy printed in red, white and green on an outline of Italy.    d) I am in a restaurant with a several people.  The restaurant is kind of run down but seems like it should serve good, greasy food.  A woman who is apparently an old classmate from Emory is asking about Turner's relationship with his girlfriend.  I am about to answer honestly as best I know but the other old classmates I am with step in and act defensively to prevent the woman from getting additional information.  Suddenly it is just me and another person.  Our names are called and we go get our food.  e) I am with a guy like Kevin who used to work at Centerstone.  We are driving a big van around somewhere in the northwest -- Idaho?  I am helping him with jobs or learning his job?  IT would take more muscle than I currently have.   
3324 20060925101610 There's Mrs. ____'s place, someone said, and in my dream I could remember both her name and the dark glasses she would wear as she drove her son to school in her old station wagon.  We went up the steep driveway behind the woods behind my parents' house, to her home where Carl Weinfeld used to live.  At the top of te drivewaythe trees were all cleared andit was a hotel in the style of a western frontier town.  We passed a restaurant where we knew we were to meet a successful young man who would help us get oriented to the city.  We saw him in there with some business contacts and did not want to intrude.  We drove off looking for his apartment.  Past the hotelwhich was shaped like an "l", darkshingle siding, it had beent here since the turn of the century, the view opened out to a city street; I drove down it looking for the apartment 3217.  We couldn't find it over and over though I looked and turned around several times. We found ourselves back near the restaurant and I had a flash of insight -- we needed tofind building 3201 and the other numbered apartments would be within that numbered building.  BUt we were by the restaurant and the young man came out and requested, insisted that we go inside.  It may have been dangerous for us to continue to drive around looking for him.  There was an ongoing salad buffet except you placed an order for it and the waiter or waitress brought it to you.  It was the end of the afternoon so my sister, mom and I got a salad that was mostly a big grey button=down women's shirt, four grey handkerchiefs, light to dark, some purple onion, sliced carrots and dressing.  My mom and sister were talking about plastic bowls that could beused to make paste.  I sat with the gentleman whose house we were lookign for. We were staying with him through the end fo the week.mmKate was leaving before us and on Friday I would go back to Long Island to spend some time with my family and friends.  "Tell me more," I told the man who sat at a bar height breakfast counter on the opposite side of me.  He hit his fist against the table and I did the same with mine.  "Do we have a movement to open this meeting?" I asked.  "No," he said jokingly but vehemently.  We looked over to see a young Asian coupletalking anxiously to one another. "I do not have the Bartons," the young lasy with her long hair of gold said.  Her young man with a shock of white hair was getting upset.  THey looked through the room trying to find her pair of clear glass boots. They would be a perfect match (besides color) to the gold metallic glass boots she had on.  Finally they looked int he washer.  Among the clothes they found them.  The lady put them on.  We alked over to another section of te room, now a laundromat.  "Gently, gently," someone said. "Do you ever walk ont hese really har by mistake," I asked the lady, now a boy.  The youth smiled and jumped up and down hard. the left boot broke.  we were on the other side of the room once more.  the boy witht he boots was freaked out.  as a beautiful japanese woman, about fifty or sixtywith her hair all white, came over and held inher arms the youth witht he white hair,both of htem squatting ont he floor, the youth with the glass boots, one of them broken, stood behind them and made the sign of his throat being slit.   
3329 20030208104207 I am sad because I just deleted all that I had written, prompting me to have to write it again   I'm not going to write it all again.  Only the middle third.   (In the last third, lots of red ants paraded through my Aunt Kathy's house in pursuit of a  ring pop ...and my sis Sass tried to mark her dining preferences for a high school reunion by clicking on intricately drawn icons online...and my sis Kate rhapsodized about a really bad eighties rocker song akin to Motley Crue's "Home Sweet Home":  I know I'm a witness/I know I've held a broken heart  That's what she was singing.  But that's not what I'm going to write about.)  In the middle third of my dream, I'd gone outside the house that was supposed to be my Aunt Kathy's but didn't look anything like it.  It was a day of February spring thaw, a grey day with the air still chill.   There was a small plot of cultivated land--maybe about twenty feet by fifteen feet--to the side of the house.  An eight foot tall row of sugar cane stood sentry at the front of the plot.  Did they move or did I think they moved because of the pattern they made against the open sky, their dark forms against the white sky? They looked like a row of strong dancers in dark forest green, rusty orange-red, a green somewhere in between lime and spring.  They bent without apparent motion in the wind--as though I viewed them in a painting where the artist had captured motion right in the middle of its movement.    Beyond the cane, which served as a wind break for the side entrance of the house, stood two more cultivated rows.  There was a row of barren grape vines, splayed on the ground like tumbleweeds.  Beyond that were palm-leaved plants with overlapping feathery fronds shimmering past each other like  moire patterns .  The plot of cultivated land sloped into a broad stretch of grass which ended at a long stretch of woods that extended along the horizon.   The woods stood dark beneath the broad expanse of slate-white sky, stark negative patterns against a positive background.  The woods themselves were full of dinosaur-era tree ferns, strands of tall grasses, palms: it was a decorative forest, like a tapestry's stylized version of foliage or the background of a  Rousseau painting .  I was trying to decide how I would use my four colors of ink (pink, blue, orange, and black, which is what I have in waking life, truly) to make a three-color block print of this scene.  I was stuck on figuring out how to make light green from those colors.  Suddenly there was another stand of sugar cane, in the woods this time--a stand of rust red, burnt orange and lime green, which sounds hideous but was actually  one of the most beautiful things ever .  I suddenly realized how to make my color print, and how to make my picture, like the first stand of sugar cane, seem to be moving and still at once.  I walked back towards my aunt's house.  There were two giant wrought iron towers--easily each about seventy feet high.  Each had a weather vane at its top, on a platform on which someone could stand.  One vane was in the shape of a galloping horse; the other, in the image of a crowing rooster.  The wind was out of the north.  In front of the glass sliding door, I was leaping and dancing, in a manner that in waking life I am unfortunately unable to do.   
3332 20030616103007 The back room of my parents' home, only higher ceilinged, vast like a cathedral, and piled with stuff.  My mom's paintings were rolling around on wheels of their own volition, like possessed robots.  My mom had created canvases 30 feet by 40 feet, a long time ago--but the canvases were themselves composed of variously sized, framed sections, each with a section of the whole image at a slightly different scale than the others.  At the moment all the individually framed sections had been taken apart for storage.  When they moved, they rolled with jerking motions, like the non-biomechanical gait of a metal insect.  It was night and I was alone, watching the paintings moving from a perch on a ladder, thirty feet off the ground.  My Aunt Barbara was painting the broad mud mesas on a hiking trail somewhere near our house.  The land was parched and baked by sun.    I had decided not to do my homework for the class I didn't want to attend.  It was a psychology of nursing class, maybe, or a social work class.  A man's patient had died, from over-excitation and lack of love.  In the classroom what I really longed for was a slate board of my own to write down little notes for myself.  I realized I needed to meet my sister Kater, so I hurriedly drank a glass of water--it tasted metallic, like people had been soaking nickels in it--and ran out the door.  Outside was broad sunlight.  I saw sis Kate on the corner.  She was asking where the car was.  We were in an old city like Philly or Boston, and the old tenements rose high above us on all sides of the street.    "I've got to leave at twelve-twenty," she said, talking about her plane.We were hurrying to the airport; she was eating an "avitar" health bar.  When we arrived a woman in uniform standing in front of a moving sidewalk asked if she wanted more bars.  Kate said yes, and the woman asked for $168.  Then she went and pulled off Kate's luggage from another converyor belt and dropped it off in front of her.    It was July and the snow was out.  My dad and Brandon were talking about the manufacture of various types of foam insulation.  There was a big pile of it lodged in an open steel framed shelving unit, and I was looking through it.  I stpped looking through it to walk with my mom, who felt sad.  On the scraggly rhododendron a few buds were just now appearing.  In a new action movie, the opening credits were running.  A man was flying through the city, the lights of his plane making strange, persistent patterns on the skyscrapers of the Gotham-like city--colored lines like flame tests, lines that ran straight and then bent at ninety degree angles to make stairs leading up a building, or zig-zags going down.  The lights were like lasers.  The effect was distracting enough that you really couldn't focus on the plane.  He was a thief; he landed on a roof in his (now) helicopter.  With a rope he threw down a lock and key onto a manhole cover, high up on the 130th story of this building.  The tunnel that he unlocked went all the way down to the ground.  His band of ragamuffins, robbers, brigands and ne'er-do-wells were down there, piled up and scrambling to the top like a nest of rats suddenly exposed to light.  One shaven-headed man reached the top, an enormous gold nugget in his mouth.  "Here it is, boss," he said.  
3332 20060925101808 -There's Mrs. ____'s place, someone said, and in my dream I could remember both her name and the dark glasses she would wear as she drove her son to school in her old station wagon.    We went up the steep driveway behind the woods behind my parents' house, to her home where Carl Weinfeld used to live.  At the top of te drivewaythe trees were all cleared andit was a hotel in the style of a western frontier town.  We passed a restaurant where we knew we were to meet a successful young man who would help us get oriented to the city.  We saw him in there with some business contacts and did not want to intrude.  We drove off looking for his apartment.  Past the hotelwhich was shaped like an "l", darkshingle siding, it had beent here since the turn of the century, the view opened out to a city street; I drove down it looking for the apartment 3217.  We couldn't find it over and over though I looked and turned around several times. We found ourselves back near the restaurant and I had a flash of insight -- we needed tofind building 3201 and the other numbered apartments would be within that numbered building.  BUt we were by the restaurant and the young man came out and requested, insisted that we go inside.  It may have been dangerous for us to continue to drive around looking for him.  There was an ongoing salad buffet except you placed an order for it and the waiter or waitress brought it to you.  It was the end of the afternoon so my sister, mom and I got a salad that was mostly a big grey button=down women's shirt, four grey handkerchiefs, light to dark, some purple onion, sliced carrots and dressing.  My mom and sister were talking about plastic bowls that could beused to make paste.  I sat with the gentleman whose house we were lookign for. We were staying with him through the end fo the week.mmKate was leaving before us and on Friday I would go back to Long Island to spend some time with my family and friends.    -Tell me more, I told the man who sat at a bar height breakfast counter on the opposite side of me.  He hit his fist against the table and I did the same with mine.    -Do we have a movement to open this meeting? I asked.    -No, he said jokingly but vehemently.    We looked over to see a young Asian coupletalking anxiously to one another.  -I do not have the Bartons, the young lady with long hair of gold said.  Her young man with a shock of white hair was getting upset.  THey looked through the room trying to find her pair of clear glass boots. They would be a perfect match (besides color) to the gold metallic glass boots she had on.  Finally they looked int he washer.  Among the clothes they found them.  The lady put them on.  We walked over to another section of the room, now a laundromat.    -Gently, gently, someone said.  -Do you ever walk on these really hard by mistake, I asked the lady, now a boy.  The youth smiled and jumped up and down hard. the left boot broke.  we were on the other side of the room once more.  the boy witht he boots was freaked out.  as a beautiful japanese woman, about fifty or sixtywith her hair all white, came over and held inher arms the youth witht he white hair,both of htem squatting ont he floor, the youth with the glass boots, one of them broken, stood behind them and made the sign of his throat being slit.   
3352 20031126002008 23 Nov.  1) Driving Bryce's van haphazardly with another passenger, and eventually Casey Gill.  The bike inside the chi-chi shop; I barely miss grazing the all-white mannequin as I haul it round the inside.  2) Walking with the bike up the stairs into corporate hell, row upon row of computers, pressed side to side like suburban houses without even a strip of grass between them.  The compartmentalization of labor to ridiculous extremes.  3) The auditorium where we are to work in groups--I am in elementary school again, it seems, looking for Doug Feldman.  Jessie, Marco, other students from Landrum are here mixed in with students from past school days.  4) We are waiting for one girl in particular before we begin; my mom is teaching a workshop but we cannot start without this missing girl.  Her trailer park mom comes in, bleached blond hair and ravished beautiful made-up face.  The woman is pushing one baby stroller with one hand, carrying an infant car seat with baby inside in the other.  She's trailed by a crew of women and their offspring.  "Get the hell away from that," she says to one of the kids, loud enough to shock the entire cafeteria population. The missing girl sits down among us--I think her name is Sam--she is half Korean, with a beautiful moon shaped face and pale cornsilk hair. She is old for her age.  5) The course begins.  I am sitting next to sis Sass, who is only eight or nine.  We are to paint "in the style of Rodin"--a series of ink blobs, sharp angles blothches--nothing like how I remember Rodin to be, but I begin to think of myself as working with ink as he might have worked with wax or bronze.  I am drawing a horse, trying to block out its form with bits of paper as one might add clay to a sculpture to build up mass, then pare it down to make details.  But I try unsuccessfully. I have turned the background of my image into a awful mire of multicolor swirls.  Sass wants to switch chairs with me--she wants the pink throne on which I am sitting.  Suddenly I am outside.  6) I am painting on the sidewalk, trying to draw the horse's shadow as it would appear if the horse stood above me, twenty feet tal, seen from the elevated walkway above my head.  My painting is transformed into an abstract piece of greens--I suddenly like it, a little bit.  Something about it reminds me of a mechanized horse, a horse taken apart and reassembled out of springs, gears and cogs.  24 Nov.  1) I am an orphan, returning to my foster mother's house as an adult.  2) My parents' upstairs bedroom.  The rain and the wind coming in, but the window is broken.  I try to fix it, but the top is made of linoleum, and fraying sisal rope, tied through small holes at the top, is crumbling the window apart.  The frame will drop and break the glass. The wind and the rain pour in.  25 Nov.  1) I see the blind squirrel that I watched yesterday in real life; only in my dream it has reappeared on one of the lawns in our neighborhood, and I am happy to see it still alive.  2) Gretta Cohn's talk on design, concurrent with an art exhibit at a library in Texas.  3) Mark Sloniker and I are going to drive back from Texas.  We look at the route and decide that we will, after all, drive through Scranton on Interstate 81.  "I'll help you navigate," I say.  In my dream I feel I have made this trip many times. 
3422 20060222091008 I had to leave my family because I was very upset about something, but I did not want to talk with anyone about it.  My Nanny tried to tlak with me but I just smiled without responding.  THen I was trying to gather belongings from the upstairs of a house that was similar tomy mom's and dad's but very different.  One half of it had been sealed off and was laying unused.  This is where I had been hiding my stuff in prepartion to leave.  I ran upstairs to grab it but my dad was coming up too.  I went a back way into a passage that was like a larger version of the wall storage area in my parents' old room.  Suddenly I wasn't mad anymore, just sad that I had to leave.    ..... (more here but I forget it.  boats in the harbor?  walking the docks.).....Bryce and Liz; a new warehouse?  Cara Augello in the break area of a school.  People come in and out in their Mardi Gras beads and costumes.  "I know it sounds strange," Cara tells me, "but I think that I am finally going to start collecting music after all these years.  You know, on cd.  ___________ by ____________ (I couldn't understand her but I was embarrassed to ask her to repeat herself -- I alreadyhad to lean in close to hear her), Uncle Tupelo and Americana, ______________, The Sea and Land, _______________."    One person walking in was commenting on my headdress, the old snap bead necklace I used to have from Nanny.  "You know, Cara," I said, "I realize this isn't quite the point of your plan but I have some cds you could borrow."  Outside, walking down the rocky slope of the shaded river-stream.  The banks were smooth grey rock that sloped down sharply and here, where the river changed course, lots of foam had built up.  "Yes, here is where we would go for a shower," one of my companions, maybe Sarah, said.  One whole section of the bank was covered in the river foam so we walked down through it.  The opposite banks were limestone rock, layered in strata.  I could see now that someone had carved stone steps on one section of the opposite bank and water flowed down these like a waterfall.  We walked across.  I kept my shoes on.  My mom came to join us.  On the other shore a young boy, about four or five, ran toward the river.  His dad was running after him but it wasn't quite certaint that he would catch the kid before he jumped in the water.  So I ran to the other side to catch the boy if necessary, but the dad found him in time.  He was rough leading the kid away however.  Later, driving car through town.  I was supposed to meet Denny Adcock to drive to Smithville (?),  But I left all my belonging next to my car because I thought we were just taking a testdrive in his car first before setting out on the road.  We passed the old interstate, now closed going through Nashville, replaced by a different road:  "Highway 80, Condemned.  No entry permitted."  Carl Lambert had taken a series of pictures on this road.  Later still, driving through town late for work.  But hten when I parked I would up at a municipal building with one side taken up by an organization dedicated to independent local art groups.  Eric Denton was signing in for Plowhaus.  I talked with TIffany for a while.  She was sitting there in a green dress that was actually a nightgown.  Sam Callahan was laughing at this, but TIffany had worn it all day yesterday too, while she helped out decorating the gym for the high school prom.  
3439 20030308132807 My Pop-Pop was staggering around; he was dressed in  black suit and dark tie.  He had eaten some cheese and spinach dip he'd made, and he thought that the spinach had gone bad.  Though he couldn't talk in words anymore, we understood what he was saying as he moved his mouth.  My Aunt Barbara was telling him to take it easy, not eat any more; she helped him to his feet.  There was a plot of land bordered by scrub brush and small trees.  To my left there were some contemporary houses; one of the homeowners had fenced in the plot of land; to keep people in or keep the brushland out.  There was a sign posted that said "No Trespassing", but someone had taped a handprinted sign--"Do Not Attempt to Climb Up Over Fence".  In the distance strange prehistoric mammals were running through the brushland.  Wild boars with stetched out bodies fifteen feet long, small compressed dogs with lean wolf heads and tusks were chasing each other.   We were close by the fence and the animals smelled us.  They came over to the fence and I felt for a minute like I might be able to touch them, but they snarled and grimaced at us and I knew they were wild.  A big reddish-brown dog--something akin to a cros between a golden retriever and a bloodhound--ran over on our side of the fence, snarled at the boar creature and dog-wolf just beyond, jumped over the fence and fell on them snarling.  "Poor thing," we said.  We knew the prehistoric animals would kill him.  A small girl kept trying to pet some of the other animals.  We moved her away from the fence, then looked up and saw a swirl of dust across the brushland.  We heard the punding of many hooves.  "Rhinoceros!" we said, looking at each other in alarm. These rhinoceros were strange and animotronic.  They looked like they were made of plates of metal; at the same time, they had the body shape of buffalo, but they could also rear up on their hind legs like stallions--and they could even climb.  We scrambled back to the comparative safety of a wooden jungle gym, but even there we were not safe; the rhinos had jumped the fence and they were trying to climb up the jungle gym to catch us.  I was at a post office and saw my old friend Cris Alonso.  I waved and started talking to her, but she had a customer.  I thought maybe she didn't like me anymore, since I had never returned her e-mails, and that was why she was ignoring me now.  I decided to buy some stamps to see if I could talk to her face to face.  There were two designs I wanted to choose from--two illustrators were being honored on two different stamps .  I never could purchase them, though--the post office closed and Cris disappeared into her car.    People were putting on outlandish Halloween or Mardi Gras costumes.  My sister had one with a great big hoop around her waist, swathed in pale orange fabric with large orange foam stripes running across it.  Another person had an embroidered shirt over a tank top with her midriff exposed, and baloony pantaloons that cut off at her knee.  I think she was a pirate.  (Aaaargh, matey.)  All of the people with costumes on, however, were large--statuesque, if you will.  An old old lady reporter, put together and glmorous, was trying to interview us.  She glanced out the window to where I could see people setting up tents on the hillside.  "Oh, it's gotten below freezing again," she said, and I noticed that tiny snow flakes were falling softly.  
3442 20030519091007 Ice cream with my fam--my dad was treating us to ice cream from an old-fashioned place that looked like it was inside a house.  Sassy was with me and we were lingering in the back, trying to decide what to get so that we could share it with Kate and with Nanny once we got home.  The problematic thing for me--besides the fact that I didn't want to get and eat a quart of ice cream--was that all the flavors, once I looked more closely, were named after different aspects of Catholic dogma or folk belief. My sister and I were debating who should get the mix of raspberry and Virgin Mary vanilla, and who should get the Trinity fudge swirl.  At the home of Cherylin Curtin, an old high school acquaintance, I began to realize how many people, mostly women, had been killed tragically since our graduation.  I was growing out my hair because I was going to appear as Sacajawea in an upcoming play.  I was practicing moving like someone swift of foot, but I kept bumping into things.    All of these events really seemed as though they were occuring on the property of our down-the-street neighbor, Debbie Iberger.  As I walked out of Cherylin's house, I saw several large rabbits grazing.  It was dusk, and the rabbits were simultaneously shadowy and precise in the evening light.  They were enormous, almost two feet long and a foot-and-a-half high. Though Cherylin and I were supposed to go down the path to sit in a tent and wait for an important message, I stopped for a moment and held out my hand for the rabbits to sniff.  Several came up to me--there were about four altogether--and there noses were soft and curious, like horses snffing to see if you have a carrot or a sugar cube.    But one rabbit, as I looked, turned into a nasty miniature poodle/terrier.  It followed me to the tent and kept biting me.  I tried to push it away but it persisted.  Its bites really hurt.  I walked around to the back to ask someone's advice on what to do. Small children, mostly boys, had constructed an enormous play fort out of scrap wood.  The fort was almost forty feet high and fifty feet long.  Little boys were scaling its walls making repairs and improvements.  Then I remembered--I was supposed to be supervising these children--I was their teacher, and I had gone to take a break, but my break was probably over by now.    I saw the beautiful but very stern principal of our school pull the other supervisors and children over to interview them one by one.  She was sinister, for she used intimidation and seduction to get the truth out of people, then used it against them.  She had somehow gotten all the other supervisors into bed with her. Once they were there, she interviewed them, where they confessed all sorts of things.  Her lampshade, too, was an opaque screen that somehow projected the secret thoughts of the person she was talking too.  The only person that really threw her was my friend Gabby from college.  When the principal started talking to him, the lampshade started flashing all these mathematical equations.  Thsi was truly what he was thinking, not the words that came out of his mouth; but the principal could not understand.    The principal made some sort of claim as a large man walked into the room--"You don't understand [the large man's name]", she said to Gabby.  "Only I understand all these people."  But Adan, my old student, muttered under his breath, "She doesn't understand anyone." 
3444 20030211081008 All little sisters like to try on big sister's clothes   My sisters and I were staying over my Nanny's old house.  Kate and I  were having a sleepover in my Nanny's old bedroom--it was six-thirty  a.m., and Kate had just gone to to bed at three a.m.  Though we were in  my Nanny's old bedroom, I was looking in the closet of the old guest room, the one that led to the attic.  It was far neater than it had ever  been. All my Aunt Ginny's dress-up clothes from the early- and mid- eighties were hanging up there, in their full shoulder-padded glory.    There was a cool old dress from my Aunt Barbara.  It had Jackie-O  styling, circa early sixties--an A-line with scoop neck, pale brown  worsted material overall with blue and ecru stripes at the top and at  the bottom--but made from synthetic material instead of wool.  The   hemline fell just below knees.  I swapped the long lime green dress my  Nanny gave me for this one.  At some point earlier or simultaneously  Rick and I were going to pick  up his eyglasses or his hair, I could never figure out which.  We  journeyed through a massive labyrithine mall to the seemingly last  store, a giant high-ceilinged barber-shop, covered floor-to-ceiling with  cheesy hairstyling photos.  The young woman behind the counter  redirected us an office in the maze of cubicles and restrooms in the  hallways behind the mall.  We were looking for the office, number 1000.   I was astonished and puzzled by the extreme number of restrooms.   Back in my Nanny's old bedroom, a middle-aged woman was sitting on the  floor talking about her experience as a watercolorist.  She had created  a character who was a girl and then a gardener at Pembroke College in Oxford.  Recently, the artist had staged a big "watercolor shoot" at  Pembroke; she invited lots of people and then painted them.  However, it  didn't go exactly as planned.  Because her character was a gardener, the  artist painted a lot of fresh flowers--a good thing; they turned real  and took root, attracting lots of tourists to the college.  However, the  people who showed up for her watercolor shoot all wanted something for  free.  People, for example, for whatever reason, had lent clothes for  the watercolor shoot.  As a symbol of recognition, the artist had gotten  small clocks for the donators, but then the people complained that their  clocks were too small and they wanted three each.  People kept trying to  steal the flowers, so the artist had to get someone to stand guard all  the time.  People kept complaining about how the artist had represented  them in watercolor: how small they appeared, and how blurry.  We were watching a skit on Nanny's t.v., perhaps on a late-night show.   A famous comic from Saturday Night Live or a similar improv comedy show was the guest.  The guest looked kind of like Woody Harrelson with a  serious mullet and molest-tache.  The host, a man, welcomed him on, all  the while making digs on his intelligence, or lack thereof.  The host  disappeared suddenly.  There was another person on stage, standing and  making small talk with the guest.  Suddenly, a new person appeared-- clearly the host dressed up as a larger woman, in a cableknit sweater  and casual knee-length skirt.  The host/woman was acting coy but at the  same time clearly trying to pick up the Woody Harrelson figure.  The  skit was supposed to be funny but it wasn't, and some of the actors knew  it.  
3496 20030522084607 Danielle and Doriet were visiting and we were discussing the impossibility of talking with someone personally in a large group.  "You never know what other people know and what they don't know," said Danielle, "so you're never sure what questions are appropriate to ask with other people present."  We were at my parents' house and we had decided to go for a walk down to the harbor before we had to bring Danielle to the bus depot for her four p.m. bus.  Doriet was going to take a big glass bottle of beer, about a liter and a half worth.  (Sorry,  Arie .)  I'd never really seen this size container before.  It may have been Japanese.  I'd thought Doriet was joking about taking it with her, but she wasn't, so I made her put it in a paper bag.  We never made it down to the harbor.  Danielle turned into my sister Kate as we walked out.  A person who looked like our round-the-block neighbor, Georgette, was mowing the grass at the boundary of Chuck and Zoe's properties.  As we walked down, though, the person turned into a boy sis Kate knew.  The bamboo were drooping down as they did when covered with snow, so that they formed a perfect shady arch over the turn in the driveway.  Only there was no snow; it was beautiful summer afternoon.   Then we were in art class.  We had each gotten a packet of flocked furry magnetic pages.  They were each a specific trope, supposedly universal, identified by an ancint Greek politician, prophet and philosopher, Skanakoploses.  Each page had a brilliantly colored picture, seemingly cut out of different papers and materials and then reproduced, and the word for that dream image in a format that was simultaneously Greek and English.  We were doing a project where we would choose one of these images to alter.    At first I hated the book.  I was very convinced it "wasn't art", whatever that meant.  I was angry, even, that someone had spent so much time analyzing their own work (in other words, their dreams) that they had made an encyclopedia of them.  It seemed like a waste of time.  I was tired of analysis: "leave it for the literary theorists," I said to myself.  Then some people were pointing out the beauty of some of the pages--particularly a page that was mainly a green, slightly textured rounded hill, with a bright blue cerulean sky, and a tiny, furry marmoset that ran almost the whole length of the hill.  The book  itself was a strange size--a little bit squatter than a marble composition book.  I wrote on the beautiful page in an ugly hurried scrawl, "Do you think this little page is beautiful?"  We had hand-sewn tiny books to use as journals, and at first I was trying to record my dream of Georgette mowing our neighbor's lawn.  I realized I had written so many pages about art and the distinction between art and design, and art and the analysis of art: a ridiculous diatribe. But the pages were almost illegible because I'd written them sloppily, as I fell asleep in class, with my rainbow pencil.  I had to go; now Rick and I were going to both ride the bus back to wherever it was that we were going.   Brandon  had been up in New York, too, and was heading back to Nashville, but we were concerned his plane would be delayed because he was flying out of Buffalo.  Though it was the middle of summer, there was a lot of snow there.  Brandon had found a comic strip called "Alesandra", but it turned out to be just a version of  Pickles  with a little girl character that made racist unfunny jokes.  
3524 20030518095808 haruspicate or scry   We had lost our ability to distill the essence of meaning from things, claimed the author of the book that Molly, Rick and I were reading together.  We had grown so used to being beaten over the head with the meaning of things that we were no longer comfortable with or capable of ambiguity or multiple meanings; nor did we have the capacity to draw out the meaning of something difficult but clear.  To remedy this situation,the author, a friendly professorial type, had created a workbook.  The workbook demonstrated a specific technique for reading, but the author wanted people to generalize it for use in eeryday life and conversation.  We were looking through it together, first in a Wal-Mart type place, then at the kitchen table of a house we needed to leave shortly in order to arrive on time somewhere else.  The book was filled with strange scenarios--brief synopses of the settings for events followed by snippets of conversation which you then had to use to decipher what had actually transpired; excerpts of poems from which the author would pull two (or sometimes a couple more) phrases and display them in a bulleted list underneath the excerpt.  This bulleted list formed the basis for a longer interpretive essay, and for questions to help you understand the work--but the whole point was for you to start making these bulleted lists, distilling the themes or major points in your head whenever you read an excerpt or encountered a real-life scenario.  The author's undidsclosed but primary point seemed to be that most of our communication was relational and metaphorical--that if we could find the two things that were being compared to one another, we could understand what was being said.  There was a poem by Paul Dunbar, for example, and the two words to distill from the four line poem were something about race and something about a Dutch cheese (Van something). It had a snippet of a poem by a contemporary poet, a female writing about dieting: "She knows diabetes is her sea/So she takes C--and G+"  This poem made no sense to me, nor why the poet was comparing dieting, the sea, and diabetes.  There was a discusssion of an eighth grade field trip where everyone was getting dehydrated and eating too much sugar, but you had to determine that only through disjointed pause- and slang-filled phrases of adolescents.  The book had a discussion of the total number of cats that had lived on the earth, ever.  It may have been related to a discussion of  "As I Was Going to Saint Ives" , but I don't think so.  I was not even trying to do the math, at least not very wholeheartedly, but I had come up with a very large number.  I kept wanting to check to see if it was correct, but the book was always just out of reach.  In my dream, far earlier, I had dreamed long ago that my Pop-Pop had died and come back to life briefly.  I had dreamed a great winding road before me.  We were driving to the airport when I had the realization he had come back to life.  Southwest planes kept crashing in the sky above us as we drove to the airport. The wings of a plane would drop off as they were coming in to land, and they would careen out of control and smash into another plane mid-air.  I wondered what his coming back to life would do to my Nanny.  Suddenly I learned that my Nanny had brain cancer, only she had never said anything about it because she did not want to detract attention from my great-aunt, her sister, who has lung cancer.  I was suddenly so sad. 
3547 20030305160208 And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes I'll see you on the dark side of the moon   My mom, my sisters and I were about to take a trip to a tropical paradise.  It was winter and I was looking forward to hanging out someplace warm.  But when I got to my mom's classroom (we were going to leave as soon as her schoolday was over), my mom let me know we weren't going to take the trip.  "Someone else got the prize pack," she said.  Apparently, our trip hinged on whether or not we won a dream vacation contest.  But now my sisters, a bunch of other students from my high school days, and I were being trained to play a "living chess game" on a volcanic island.  For a second, though, I was at my parents' home trying to find an old black bathing suit of mine--the terrycloth one that I had brought with me was old and fragiada.  I couldn't find it, although sis Kate had a bunch of dresses that I wanted to take back with me to wear. (Thinking it over, though, I realized I wouldn't have that many opportunities to wear them on the volcanic island, and I wasn't certain how I would get any of my supplies or clothing back to the mainland.)  In the meantime, my mom was berating me.  "How many packs of carrots did you eat?" she asked.  I'd only eaten one-and-a-half, I told her. She was yelling at me because my face was breaking out.  She was also talking about my Pop-Pop's sister, her Aunt Fanny.  The connection was dubious, but I think my mom didn't want me to end up like her.  In my dream, though, I felt great tenderness for my Great-Aunt Fanny, who in real life I did not know that well.  In my dream my Aunt Fanny was talking to me from beyond her grave; she was floating in what looked like the watery patterns in a David Hockney landscape, and telling me how sad she had been in life.  Back on the island we were seated cross-legged in a circle on the floor. Each of us had a specific way we could move--this was determined both by the rules of the game and the strategy of the mission.  We were on the island for two reasons--one, the reason the outside world saw, was entertainment; the other, known to ourselves alone, was a special mission.  Suddenly I wasn't part of the group anymore--I saw myself scramble off across the black volcanic rock and the lava, dried into mountains and eroded into fantastic spires, but my observing eye was able to see myself and everyone else in the group.  I saw how, for each figure, a little imp--with two curved horns, bigger or smaller depending on the person--scrambled behind them, dogging their step.  Most people did not notice the imp, but a few felt something behind them.  They would stop every once in a while to look behind--but the imp would duck behind a rock.  Finally a few travellers whirled around and confronted the imp--and then the travellers themselves got very scared, and didn't know what to do.  It seemed the imp would catch them, maybe do something bad to them right there.  In my dream I was screaming at them--"Run, run to the large group!  Don't just stand there, paralyzed!"  but that's most often what these people would do--stand there, or climb to the top of a tall volcanic spire, where they were essentially trapped.  In my dream, I suddenly realized the phase of the moon.  It was just new.  Here on this volcanic island, I realized, was the only place in the world one could see the dark side of the moon.  I went to take a  look ;. Somewhere, faintly, Pink Floyd was playing "Home, home again/ I like to be there when I can."   
3553 20031110103607 The potential site for the Untitled show--the entrance marked by the sudden disappearance of a subterrenean stream; our movement across an elevated concrete walkway into a vast network of rooms, all submerged and cavernous.  The ceilings were church high--maybe fifty, seventy, or eighty feet--but all the rooms were dark, a brown and gray dark, as though somewhere sunlight was trying to get in, and succeeding only to fail.  We were riding a gondola at soem part as the rooms snaked on and on, deeper into the earth.  One of our party mentioned that we would need to get shuttle buses to transport people bac and forth between downtown parking centers and the underground caverns.  Our entry into the mansion home, playground, and now museum of someone rich.  I was at the head of a ragtag bunch all eager to run around and explore--the larger group we had come in with lagged behind.  A small child, her mom or caretaker still lingering in back--ran in front with us, and I kept an eye on her.  We climbed suspended steel stairways, wrought iron like fire escapes, fantastically stretched between nowhere and nowhere, endlessly cascading up and down.  The steps of the suspended stairs were open, like real fire escapes, and you could glimpse dizzingly between the open gratings the farmland and woods of the countryside, two hundred feet below.  The stairs were a maze of infinity.  Some sections were walled off--some sections shared a transistional platform on to which you could hop, then spring off on to the new segment.  We were gathered at the mansion for a design conference, but I was not getting to attend any sessions because I had to look after children whose own caretakers were sneaking off to workshop sessions.  Finally, it was time to go and we were gathering our things--there was something embarrassing about the stuff I had to pack, but I don't remember what. Women in our group I thought had been my friends were shunning me, in part because they were angry that they didn't get more credit and compensation for research they had contributed on an archaeological dig they had participated in.  I learned of the lake we would soon pass, a twin of one I had seen in Montana and one nestled in the mountains we would have to cross.  I had thought it formed by a crater--it was wide and shallow, like a bowl--but it was actually created through mountain uplift.  We were watching and somehow in a movie--a gang of bandits helping a family and a woman escape from another family that wanted to entrap the woman.  The gang of bandits, led by Clint Eastwood, had just had the tire of their Conostoga wagon shot out from under them, and were now riding on the rim.  One of the pursuing party leapt out of the wagon and slid down on his backside on the mud slide just next to the cornfield, shooting to kill as he did so.  He dragged an enormous white horse behind him, the horse also on its backside.  Clint, in the cornfield, lay on his stomach carefully aiming his rifle.  I realized he was aiming for the horse, and that when he shot it and it fell it would fall forward pinning this man to the ground.  My Nanny came into her darkened kitchen in her old house to let me know she was around and would be coming to visit earlier.  Earlier, a woman had killed herself unexpectedly; I learned of the news while I was in my Nanny's upstairs bathroom, and the shock of it twisted like a knife in my stomach.  Just the night before I had seen this woman, laughing and (seemingly) happy.  In the bathroom were bits of blood. 
3587 20060730132207 dream of the other day  In the night under dark skies, with flourescent street lights above us making pools and pockets of brightness.  The building behind us, some sort of school, had a curving ramp that was almost like a ladder of a staircase.  Maybe it was most comparable to a DNA double helix, except only one of the helixes.  People were stationed, sitting standing or laying down, at various points on it.  I was walking up the rise, with teenage boys laying down at various points.  I spoke with Jayson Boynton for some time, with knowledge of the passing of ten years since my graduation from high school.  dream of 7/29  Old run-down PIlgrim State building.  At first inside, trying to wrap up some meaningless paperwork, older guys in their forties acting vaguely annoying, collecting information for some out-of-country trip I dind't actually want to go on.  Small children, Beth's maybe, running around.  Outside, walking on the institutional grounds, well maincured, the impression of an old SUNY school, brick buildings and wide walkways.  Someone passed me and from the noce I recognized Jen Braun. She kept walking, along with her mom and Columbian friend.  I ran up to her, introduced myself, and hugged her.  I was about to cry becuase the hug was also an act of conciliation, an attempt to make good all the times I had thought unkind thoughts about her in high school.  Jen Braun had become more beautiful, but she had a brace-like appartus on one of her front teeth: a rubberband fit around the tooth snugly and a plastic wire stretched from it to one of her top canines.  Her teeth looked almost perfect, straight and white, but I realized this was to pull the bottom canine out just a bit to make sure it was perfectly square with the others.  As I spoke with someone the bus we rode on took us further and further up a wooded road.  I knew I wouldhave longer and longer to walk or even run back wiht each further bit the bus went, so I was trying to detach myself fromt he conversation gracefully.  When I returned the phone rang and Franne came up with a portable phone, asking me if I could talk with the person on the other end.  It turned out to be a woman coordinating travel arrangements for the group.  She asked me to give the names of everyone attending.  I hadn't really been attempting to coordinate this part, so I just started naming off names, counting off on my fingers as I walked intot the building.  The woman asked me to repeat the names, and I could nopt -- I asked her if she could wait for a bit and she didn't understand what I asked, so I asked again and she begrudgingly said yes, "but only for a little bit", she was very busy.  I was lookign through papers to see if I had writtent he attendedd list anywhere.  Alison Macholz, Jen ROmer and Jennifer BRaun, Sharon Wilcox and perhaps Sabrina Crespo were all going.  Turner was there, sorting through his own papers and making beats.  He looked up where I was shuffling through these papers and told me that I should relax, that my energy was palpable, closed and angry.  I said that I was angry and that I was trying to relax and open up, but I wanted to get this ddone first.  Cris Alonso sat at the cafeteria table and I sat and was talking with her, fairly accurately remembering the dates for various events, but at some point she asked "What's Spice?" and I had to explain the house that we had lived in together.  (fragments of ealrier in the dream come to mind; endless tasks, my mom, flowers i meant to put in the fridge, dark light of rooms shuttered in mid-day)
3588 20030123075207 me dream pretty one day (between 6:30 and 6:50 am)   A David Sedaris-like narrator is giving an NPR report on his ideal summer home, which he has actually encountered and rented for twenty dollars a night at some quaint New England locale.  The main thrust of the report is how he overcame his qualms about the place, which were threefold.  One, that he will have to eat tiny, ripe, fresh homegrown cherry tomatoes (which he does--but he learns that he likes them).  Two, that he will have to stay inside the house, a tiny salt-box cottage, all the time because he doesn't enjoy sunlight (he doesn't stay inside the house all the time, or even much at all--he learns he likes the outdoors and the quality of light in this charmed village).  Three, that he will feel compelled to write all the time (which he does, but he decides that's a good thing since it makes him productive).   I actually went back to sleep hoping that my subconscious could produce a better dream (?I'm not sure what my sleepy little mind intended by the modifier "better").  The dream continued, however, with a new plot twist of a missing over-sized jersey that read, in part, "I made the perfect lay-up and all I got was this lousy tee-shirt", and the discussion and/or discovery of the codified rules of Japaneses totalitarian business regimes, somehow also linked with the rise of militarism in the Japanese state, which someone had rendered phonetically as   "kanzi-mata ."   Cougars and Coyotes and Bears, Oh My   Earlier, I was driving with Rick when suddenly we drove into a national forest.  It was some variation of the forest I always encounter in my dreams: primeval, vast, older than anything.  We entered on a crude road: great slopes of trees rose on all sides of the car, their trunks stout and fantastically twisted, matted with moss and vines yet not at all sinister looking--the trees were so tall the moss and vines looked like evening dress wraps.  The mountains they rose upon--because they were mountains that surrounded us, but the treeline went all the way up to the top--were covered with gashes and gulches.  These were animal runs, and any minute we expected an animal to come running down them.  In fact, we were convinced a cougar would run down them.  So we locked our doors and drove out.    A Lobster in Every Pot   On a beach like the ones on the North Shore of Long Island, where I grew up (really rocky, in other words), there were huge piles of detrius left by the outgoing tide.  People were grouped together all up and down the shore: they had built big cisterns out of scrap metal and other materials and were boiling lobsters inside of them. The lobsters, although already bright red, were still struggling to get out.  My family had not caught a lobster, but we had a shirt from my friend Camie that I was trying to get back to her, and that I was later reminded of when David Sedaris described his missing jersey.    The Perils of Consumerism   In other portions of the dream:  I was walking with sis Kate between two buildings, one of which was an enormous Wal-Mart.  Many people, including myself, were wearing collared pink Izod-type shirts and dark blue pleated shorts.  There was an enormous storm coming our way: indeed, it had already started raining, and Kate claimed that she had over thirty miles to walk to get back to school.  We walked together to the Wal-Mart.  As we walked in the door, the woman in front of us was talking on her cell phone and kept getting shocked by lightning.  I realized that it was Andrea Hickey from my high school.  
3614 20060910225208 the brothers and sister karamazov  lions and tigers in the petting zoo.  the lion stuck his head out between the widened bars and i knew he could escape.  i climbed the walls with the small child as the lion loosed itself from the cage, went over to the spot where the two tigers lay on straw within their pen.  i climbed higher as the tigers went free and hunting.  priapus was walking down the dark streets of rocky point, ny.  i walked with him trying to restrain him.  in the fancy restaurant with the unbuilt extension, actually a hall between the two sides of the building, lined in red velvet, the priapus man split into three, with me one of them, the analytic one, and another empathic, and the third a boy with autism, naked.  the boy had great strength.  he picked up things indiscriminately and with great ease.  one of the restaurant owners had a giant sound mixboard and the boy picked it up from one end of its eight foot length, hoisted it without trouble and began walking up the couple stairs to the main level of the restaurant, to the board owner's satisfaction, as the board had to be moved.  but the owners' mom was outside int he street, proclaiming loudly, "it's evident that soon we will no longer need old electric powered equipment."  walking in, seeing the boy carrying the board, she exclaimed sharply, "you can't do that," causing the boy to drop the mixboard, which shattered everywhere, ruined.  i thought it a strange and bitter irony that her words which had so recently proclaimed our freedom from the tyranny of electric equipment caused the much-needed electric soundboard to break.  with the breaking of the board the empathic brother and the autistic brother ran. when i ran after them we wound up settling in an apartment in los angeles, but the story of our life was presented before us in a book, in which an entire chapter was dedicated to letters i would write from our la apartment.  even after the two other brother, the empathic and the natural, had set off, the eldest son sat int eh room and continued to write, a loner and a recluse.  one day his young sister, the mystic, appeared.  "it's not you," the brother said to her in disbelief, considering her a phantasm caused by indigestion, "it's these antacids." "no," the sister said, nodding sadly, and by this the brother knew that his brother with autism had disappeared, that no one knew where he was. the girl finally convinced the letter-writing brother to leave the room. the girl had a special affinity for watermelon and one would sometimes materialize before her like a ghostly image before she entered or after she left a room.  the boy went out to search for his brother, one-third a part of him.    playing music as kate worked on her poem in the rio grande valley library.  the music i played on my viola became written on an old map and when i rested for a measure the rest was written on a body of water and the note i played next was written on an island, actually europe, followed by another sea that was a rest.  when my eyes landed again on sea i played another note.  when pink and yellow indian pipe looking things came dancing up at me fromt he page i tried my best to play the alternating notes they signified quietly, as class had already begun and continuing students were meeting in groups.  i saw linda from orchestra and someone else, kaaren engel perhaps.  but the middle-aged man in their group asked if i could stop playing, and when i said "no problem", he said, "it would have been less of a problem if you hadn't played at all", which made me want to cuss him out. 
3615 20060315084607 Though I had not yet finished packing, I knew that soon Laura Sobik and I would have to take our overseas flight, either returning from our going back to England, it was unclear.  At some point I thought we were returning -- that was because I found stacks of British stamps, all beautifully engraved, and in many denominations, including some that were like bonds or promissary notes, and very few used.  I used some to stamp some letters my sister Kate had written but never sealed or addressed.  I addressed them and got them ready to send.  I found one letter that was just afew words on a post-it -- I thought to myself that I should write a slightly longer note and stick it in.  But I put the letter to the side for the moment.    There were so many things for me to pack.  But somehow I would up in Mr. Fiorelli's social studies / psychology class -- it was a college level lecture. At some point we all had to get up and rearrange our seats.  Jacqueline Meeks and I were sitting together, so we got up but were among the last to retake our seats.  In the process we had to hand our notes in and then have them redistributed to us when we sat down -- this was a complicated way of getting someone else's notes (and perspective). However, because I asked the girl on the end who was passing out notes for two copies, I almost received our own notes again -- I hadn't seen that she had already placed two other sets by the empty desks intended for us.  We had to add a set of numbers very quickly as they were flashed on the board (24 + 46 + 1 + 8 + 3 plus I don't remember, to add up to at the end 99 + 12 = 111).  At some point I took a break to clear out my study area and load whatever was there into a box -- there was still much more to pack back at Laura's house.  It took at least and hour to get to the ariport, I knew, and our flight was leaving in little over an hour. Returning to the the classroom I saw Karen Kinslow leaving and I knew we should, too -- her flight was a little before ours.  I said goodbye to Karen, then turned to find Laura.  Laura was in the back office of the classroom talking to Mr. Fiorelli.  As I walked over she held up her keys; one was missing -- her car key.  We hadtried calling her mom but to no avail.  I suggested calling my mom but she was still in the midst of teaching.  We would have to walk to Laura's grandma's, Bobo.  We walked out the back exit.  Hordes of teachers were coming back to school.  They were all recently hired professors (or grad school teaching assistants.)  Many I recognized from other walks of life.  They all had interesting hats and matching coats or sweaters in the slightly chilly northeastern spring weather.  We saw Erika Johnson in a funny pompom hat and matching sweater, walkign among the crowd. She turned to walk with us and tell us about the results she was using from "N.W.", about the evolution of grunting in chimp communication.  She would use the experiment results in her art pieces, which was in part about the social creation of sound and its assignation to gender.  Then we walked through draped fabric to find Laura's Bobo in the back, folding laundy.  She was bigger and younger than I remembered, with black wavy hair that was almost dreaded.  Suiddenly it was Cristina Alonso, Laura Beth Cameron, and Molly standing next to me.  We all said hello.  Laura's grandma was teasing her about not having her keys, but then admitted she did have them back at the house.  Then the grandma was Laura Beth Cameron.  The anxiety about leaving for the flight on time was gone, but I woke up suddenly anyway. 
3621 20061117092209 we walked through the dusty streets past the paleterias into the live filming of the beauty contest.  we were late of course but luckily my friend had the good sense to realize that the whole thing, staged in our elementary school cafetorium, was being filmed.  so he had us sit just in front of the platform they had installed for the occassion, just behind the last contestant in line.  we made eye contact with the announcer and he looked at us to make us understand that he couldn't stop talking to warn us so he was glad we had realized that we were about to cross in front of the stage on camera.  the announcer, too, thought the event ridiculous but it paid well for him to announce it, barker style, in his white dr. livingstone suit.  as i watched one garishly made up lady berate her male partner on stage (she would insult him and then hold up a sign that said "spotlight" just above her head so that the camera would pan to her gloating face), i realized that the whole event, though real to the participants and the people in the audience, was actually being filmed for a movie. in fact, jack nicholson appeared, a younger version of him at least, as the event was taking place in the mid 80s, made his grand on-stage appearance the until-then dweeby outcast main character's "dad" (in fact the character was an orphan, jack nicholson's character the runkard who was redeemed by this boy's need for love). jack nicholson was clenaing house in hilarious fashion and all seemed poised to end well.  i had to leave out the side entrance and suddenly -- the river flowing as on the borders of many dreams, less fierce now in the depths of winter.  then i was trying to drive the car, none of the mirrors were working, and as i merged onto the street some frat boy type next to me was drinking whiskey out of a strange bottle and swerving his bread delivery truck back and forth erratically into my lane.  (later rick pulled a different strange bottle out of his pocket and asked, "johnny wlaker?  you know him?")  at the light i was trying to stop and to make sure i was not inthe turn lane.  a man let me in front of him and i realized after we had gotten through the intersection that he was actually just pushing a stroller, not driving a car.  he was a larger man.  as we walked towards another interminable set of shopping malls, i realized i had been here before.  beyond was a cliff face with  a recent theme park on it, but in reality it had been continuously inhabited and used for thousands of years.  the man asked how to get tot he mall by the theme park and i was describing it.  in a hotel room just off the shopping mall he was trying to get to, i was washing dishes in  the sink. i was thankful to find that someone had left a bottle of dish detergent on the sink counter, as i had forgotten to bring mine.  when i went to squeeze it out i found it was a bottle of watered-down joy.  in the sink there was a condom that floated to the surface when i filled upt he sink.  some group of elementary students had stayed int he hotel room and done a science project about what would rust if they left it in various materials.  their little dixie cups of rusting materials stood stacked in rows to the side of the sink island.    back at our house, amy simrell was watering and tending to our garden. int he depths of winter she replanted the squash, the peppers.  bright red peppers and dark black peppers were growing in a new plot beneath the hackberry.  i thanked her as i went back into the house.  i was on my way somewhere else to sleep, to try there to fall back asleep to dream.
3623 20060422092808 My sister Kate and I and an old friend sat together on a steamship trying to piece together the events of three years ago.  If I were back on land I would be once again late for orchestra, but as long as we were on the river land time had no effect on us.   There was a conference in an old long building, like an airport hangar, but from the 1800s.  With skis on, I skiied with my dad and another person I cannot remember down the main corridor of the building, which went on for miles.  Sometimes there was no roof, no walls -- just the outdoors -- and other times we were enclosed by four walls and a ceiling.  The sun was bright and bluish white on snow packed so firmly it glistened with ice on top.  There were hundreds of people ont he course.  My dad beckoned off to the left, where there was a path between two tussocks of snow, almost like a path through thedunes.  "Here's the old shortcut to Mount Marcy," he said, "so let's take it and see if it still leads up there."  But I had seen, just before we were about to make the turn, my dad's brother Mark and my cousin Billy (suddenly almost full-grown).  I wanted to stop and at least give them a hug, but my dad had blown them off with a cursory nod.  We started up the path. Looking back I saw them joined by my aunt Pam, so I begged my dad to go on with out me -- I'd catch up -- so that I could say hello.  I let myself tumble through a window carved in the wood onto the snow path.  I crossed it against traffice,almost making one woman fall.  On the other side I looked down to see where Pam, Mark, and Billy had gone.  But the other side, bizarrely, was a big summer lake (the other side of the one we had been on at the beginning of the dream).  I went part way down the rock scree with my skis but there was no side of my aunt and uncle and cousin.  Then I spotted them already far off, wading through a shallow part of the lake with snorkelling gear on.  I headed back for Mount Marcy, disappointed that I would not see them.  There was a whole hallway with these windows cut out of wood that had been painted over in a style at once contemporary and ancient, like middle aged manuscript illustrations.  People had scrawled political and spiritual grafitti all over these pictures, which were actually on flaps of wood that came down over where the holes were cut out of the wooden wall.  I had jumped in and out of these windows to get in and out of the wooden hall.  But now I was searching for the one picture that was big and open enough for me to jump through: it was the infant Jesus in royal robes with sceptor and crown, but as a girl.  I jumped through it again, but somehow landed inside the wooden hallway again just as a man was walkign by.  He was one of the coordinators and participants in a large and somewhat cheesy poetry conference being held there that weekend. This was a forgotten corner of their building, yet he stopped me and ordered me to leave the premises immediately.  So I jumped throught he window again, tothe path to Mount Marcy, shouting, "And you call yourself a poet ... who doesn't even value the adventure of experience?" I said this over my shoulder for comedic effect, and indeed, Andrea Montalbano, sitting to the left as I started my climb, now in the shade of another building, was laughing.  I stopped briefly to look at the graffiti scrawled in an alcove that once had held offerings in Roman times.  Responding to a political slur, once person had written: "Do they REALLY eat their babies?  Is dead REALLY better than red?" along with several other rhetorical questions I can't remember.   
3625 20060623110208 if something has to give   I saw Erika and she came over and gave me a hug.  It was very nice but then her chin had bristles on it like boar hairs.  Inside an out building which Plowhaus used to serve its refreshments during opening receptions, I was trying to gather all my belongings.  People were inthe bathroom which made it hard for me to get some things in there.  I was standing by the stove in our own kitchen talking with a man.  Because the man was black, though, white people also inthe kitchen were getting offended and concerned.  The man and I were trying to run away before people attacked him.  We were running through the rooms of our Nashville house trying to ecape three or four stupid but deadly assassins. Finally our only recourse was to lay on the floor under a blanket and pray to be invisible.  So this is what we did.  My secret hope was that the guy was magic, as I had thought he might be.  A woman who was arch-conservative was within the group going around watching the adult-themed entertainment of the out building of Plowhaus's.  I felt awkward being with them.  The old woman was not supposed to get herself into situations where she could get overly excited or upset.  I decided to leave the scene.  As I left, wandering through dark curvy streets, the new song playing in my head -- me dancing -- "i've got to xo my baby, x-xo my baby"  It was 11:37 when I looked down at a clock or watch as I went down Fairfax past Eakin.  Suddenly I was in a town area.  The Chinese restaurant was closing, the workers stood behind the counter fatigued and ready to go home, but the two women who had snuck in even though the lights were dimmed told the waitress / owner that their order would take only five to ten minutes.  I kept walking past the striking woman with her tired eyes in front of her hair salon.  Across the street the Collage Hairstylists.  I went up a set of stairs.  In the posh shoe store where I had shopped earlier in the day the shoe selection in the bargain area was still much the same.  However I decided to venture to the back. There are tons of ladies with blond or black hair and sorority girl brillaint smiles, picking up merchandise, looking it over.  I don't want to be there, especially since there's nothing but sneakers, sneaker boots, and very high-heeled boots,  but now I have accidentally bumped into a tan lady about my age or a little younger, and her boyfriend.  As we leave the room I realize I have broken the handle of the lady's woven purse, with its circular plastic handle.  "Have you ever used crazy glue?" I asked the lady.  She nodded.  "You can put that on there and fix it up," I say.  I begin to say how I had a similar purse that I found in a thrift store in ninth grade, but I broke it using it as a football.  However, the lady has started to say something to and their is an awkward pasue as we both stopo to avoid talkign over the other.    We have the awkward necessity of standing next to each other for a while as the whole floor moves in a sort of elevator.  Our "guide" lets us know that the ascent to the next floor is almost done and that the down elevaotr will be available in five minutes -- also that she can give tours for a fee.  We are passing room emblazoned with the names of exotic animals -- indian cheetah, howler monkey -- there are fawns, gigantic, sleeping in front of the gilded doors to the rooms.  We are in ascent and the guide mentions the subjects of the portraits behind us, but so fast and hurriedly that we all laugh.  The elevator took a long time.  I am singing the editors' "fall" as i wake up. 
3627 20030305115208 And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes I'll see you on the dark side of the moon   My mom, my sisters and I were about to take a trip to a tropical paradise.  It was winter and I was looking forward to hanging out someplace warm.  But when I got to my mom's classroom (we were going to leave as soon as her schoolday was over), my mom let me know we weren't going to take the trip.  "Someone else got the prize pack," she said.  Apparently, our trip hinged on whether or not we won a dream vacation contest.  But now my sisters, a bunch of other students from my high school days, and I were being trained to play a "living chess game" on a volcanic island.  For a second, though, I was at my parents' home trying to find an old black bathing suit of mine--the terrycloth one that I had brought with me was old and  fragiada .  I couldn't find it, although sis Kate had a bunch of dresses that I wanted to take back with me to wear.  (Thinking it over, though, I realized I wouldn't have that many opportunities to wear them on the volcanic island, and I wasn't certain how I would get any of my supplies or clothing back to the mainland.)  In the meantime, my mom was berating me.  "How many packs of carrots did you eat?" she asked.  I'd only eaten one-and-a-half, I told her.  She was yelling at me because my face was breaking out.  She was also talking about my Pop-Pop's sister, her Aunt Fanny.  The connection was dubious, but I think my mom didn't want me to end up like her.  In my dream, though, I felt great tenderness for my Great-Aunt Fanny, who in real life I did not know that well. In my dream my Aunt Fanny was talking to me from beyond her grave; she was floating in what looked like the watery patterns in a David Hockney landscape, and telling me how sad she had been in life.  Back on the island we were seated cross-legged in a circle on the floor. Each of us had a specific way we could move--this was determined both by the rules of the game and the strategy of the mission.  We were on the island for two reasons--one, the reason the outside world saw, was entertainment; the other, known to ourselves alone, was a special mission.  Suddenly I wasn't part of the group anymore--I saw myself scramble off across the black volcanic rock and the lava, dried into mountains and eroded into fantastic spires, but my observing eye was able to see myself and everyone else in the group.  I saw how, for each figure, a little imp--with two curved horns, bigger or smaller depending on the person--scrambled behind them, dogging their step.  Most people did not notice the imp, but a few felt something behind them.  They would stop every once in a while to look behind--but the imp would duck behind a rock.    Finally a few travellers whirled around and confronted their imps--and then the travellers themselves got very scared, and didn't know what to do.  It seemed the imp would catch them, maybe do something bad to them right there.  In my dream I was screaming at them--"Run, run to the large group!  Don't just stand there, paralyzed!" But most of the people acted exactly like foolsih characters in a horror movie--standing there until their imps caught up with them, or climbing to the top of a tall volcanic spire, where they were essentially trapped.  In my dream, I suddenly realized the phase of the moon.  It was just new.  Here on this volcanic island, I realized, was the only place in the world one could see the dark side of the moon.  I went to  take a look .  Somewhere, faintly, Pink Floyd was playing "Home, home again/ I like to be there when I can."   
3685 20060927093607 There we were again in some residence of Elvis's.  Only it wasn't Graceland and it wasn't his birthplace; it was enormous howev er and filled wiht many levels.  Before we got htere I drove with people in my car first inthe dark and then as day lifted.  I had the parking brake on repeatedly and had to pull off onto a side road that was blocked with construction in order to take it off fully.  When I stopped the car there first a woman came over to pick up a great big black fur coat she's left on the groundby the side of a building.  Then people and children, more and more of them, came out of parked cars in their various costumes, felt dreaded wigs of red for Raggedy Anns and Andys, an coat of bluer and green dreaded wool.  Before this even we were in someone's house and I had been giving out clothes.  I gave a jacket to someone but it was too small around the neckand I realized I woul d have to take her measureents.  Back later int he the Elvis house we roamed around, though many of the rooms had a passageway roped off.  This upsetme after a while as I could sense that thesewerethe rooms that had secret tunnels or passages to The house itself was on the sea and also surrounded by great brown rock cliffs that looked like frozen waterfalls. other rooms.  We walked through many rooms of a wood studio, inludingequiment hanging even inthe publi-school style bathroom.  We went to a stairway and I knew what section of thehouse we were walking through, and also how it appeared to be on one level but was actually another.  I was trying to get a postcard for Samantha.  When we came to a giftshop someone suggested I look, but I was getting hungry and the rows of glazed donuts and other pastries looked tempting.  I remembered I had left my wallet elsewhere.  I could not find postcards at first -- the current administrators of the building kept a tight role of representation of the builing in the media.  Rick's aunt Donna was buying a pastry.  Rick pointed out the postcards. I selectd one of  the brown rocks in winter tinged by dawnlight and with little caps of snow.  This would be for my dad.  I also found one of a horse and lightning bolt.  THis would be for my cousin. But I found another one my sister Sarah had written on, a message to our Aunt Joanne and her family.  How did it get here, among the blank cards, i wondered, as we had mailed it.  I realized I needed my wallet.  I ran back through the house to look for it, though I wasn't wuite sure the way to get back there.  But as I returned I realized that I couldget across to the other side of thehouse as I needed to get hte waller, if only I could go up through the secret passages.  But each time I was thwarted.  (Brief glimpse of the children's rooms up the stairs, haunted and full of passawgeways -- I'd seen them before in another recent dream).  I searched the house but really only ran through a third of it without finding trhe room where i left my wallet and shirty.  I went downstairs to find the lost and found.,  someone playing hillbilly music and serving fried chicken.  htey had a big glass container full of biscuits, some plain, some with honey on top and some with preserves.  one with blueberry topping looked too irresistable so I reached in the long cylindrical tower and pulled one out, asking one o the guys int he display booth, is it okay.  he came over and said it was but that he;s need to see id and i'd need to step outside with it -- no eating wa alllowedint he buiuling.  sarah came over and we both showed ids and i said that i should have gottent he biscuit ont he wy out as i needed to go over to the lost and found.  we went there.  iwoke up.  
3738 20030702091807 dream of 6/30  A walk through the city; a street fair.  The vendors approaching me, but I am not at liberty to do things for myself.  Carvers in cherry making table legs.    I am in a class where someone is testing me on the abbreviations Bryce uses in the shop.  "And abbn.?" someone asks.  "What does that mean?"  I have to confess to him that at that moment I cannot recall.    Sis Kate has fake teeth on metal frames, somewhat like miniature deer antlers with calcium deposits at the top of them.  She keeps snapping them in and out of her mouth, so that her gums are mottled with gaping holes and she has entire handfuls of these tooth-antlers.  dream of 7/1  My sisters were preparing breakfast: mounds of sausage hash with chunks of sausage links still sticking out, piles of raw onions and one sunnyside-up egg for each of us.  I ws trying to avoid having to eat any of it, especially because the yolk of the egg had spilled out of the center of each one and all across the white and the bottom of the platter.  Then the eggs got all stuck together on the platter; then they were scrambled and it seemed like I might be able to have a little bit of them for breakfast.  There were wild grapes on a vine, though it was still summer.  I was getting some to eat.  We were in a city somewhere in el Valle or Mexico. The light was the enchanted light of yesterday afternoon, as though the air was super-saturated and the late evening sun diffused through the heavy atmosphere like flecks of gold and rose.  All the bottoms of the buildings were in shadow, and all the tops of buildings were on fire with the pure white light of the evening sun.    Landrum was having ome sort of field trip function.  I saw in the distance, before a hotel, a man and a woman trying to calm down a kicking and jumping kid.  I went over to see what was going on.  It wasn't their kid, actually, but a child they'd found that had wandered far from home--from Ireland, as I later learned.  I took him by one hand and we set off walking up and down the hills of the city, as the sun sank further behind the buildings and the walls of each shop and apartment closed down to shadowy black.  The child was from Amsterdam, Ireland, and I let him know that that was where we were taking him.  I looked up in the sky, still rosy from the sun.  There was a giant rainbow.  Just after its midpoint on the right side there was a crook in its bands, so it looked a littlelike a cursive "n" without the leading straight line or the tail on the end.    "Look," I said to the kid whose hand I was holding.  In my dream I for some reason felt we were looking west, though I know we had to be looking east.  We scanned the sky somemore and I found the rainbow's twin, not underneath it in a faint band, as such things normally are, but next to it, with the same strange crook, only reversed.    "If we were in Hawaii, at the top of a volcano, we could see rainbows completely encircling us," I told the kid.  We kept on walking.  Inside an office complex, waiting for tickets or screening or further instruction, we gossiped about Landrum while other people looked after the kids.  Some child had found my stockpile of grapes and was eating them.  Another kid, almost four, was still breastfeeding from some lady, his wet nurse.  Marcela had a horrible toothache, and I was trying to recommend some dentists.    "It's my birth molars that hurt," she said.  We were looking through the guide to dental providers in her network but I couldn't find anyone. Then I realized I was looking at the Mexico City guide.  In the car drving with Rick I had found a Super Furry Animals cd.  Our car had acquired a cd player.  I put the cd in and we started listening. 
3742 20060224094007 a helicopter with two layers of two propellors flying outside our bedroom window.  some time after that, there is a knock on the back door that leadsinto our upstairs bedroom.  there's a whole family on the fire escape.  "the door's not open here," we say -- we're a little concerned to see people at our side door that no one even knows about, wanting to be let in. "we're just looking for a throughway through the house the man says," and we gesture towards the door again to show that it is locked, but the mom just touches the door and it swings open and her kids file in follow by he and her husband.  i recognize the woman as "bernadette" (who i don't necessarily know in real life).  i stop the kids as they are coming through the bedroom door and introduce myself.  "TimAy," says one.  "Bernadette," says another, clearly joking.  "Hello, Bernadette Jr.," i say, teasingly.  i am shaking their hands and everyone is more at ease.  the dad reminds me of a year ago, when he was called back by his seven uncles and had to leave me "in my scarlett o'hara dress" instead of hanging out with me as he had wanted to.  i realize how secretly awesome bernadette is.  her kids are playing now in a room full of toys and thy are so fun to watch. timay, the youngest, has become very young, two or three.  bernadette has given me a book, the inscription of which reads, "ali, don't let me forget to give you back your pancake [which was some sort of educational pillow / story prop i'd let her borrow to tell stories with her kids]. if my kids wind up taking this book back please tell me and i will sen dit back!  i can't wait for your tee-shirts! -b"  the book itself is super cool.  the illustrations kind of look like the ones fromt eh saggy baggy elephant, except the pages are longer and there are sheets of carbon paper so that you can trace and draw the images on the right side of the pages, which are looser, almost contour-line drawings of characters in the book.  on various pages bernadette has written questions about aspects of the designing and production processes for tee-shirts, and on one page she has just made a comment about the image of a baby elephant with his trunk stuck in a funnel: "it is like a pakistani trumpet" (or summat along those lines).  i am so honored to have a friend like bernadette i realize.  earlier:  almost getting in a fight with mom in my studio, where she is saying "i would have mailed the invite to grace earlier".  but we soon make up  in the elementary school back gym, the one that wasn't the "cafetourium".  there are aunt gin and aunt barb in traditional dress (west african for barb? austrian for gin?)  forgetting part of the gift for cuz sam (the beads) - when she finds out what i planned to give, she asks if they were letter beads with an "i" or an "s", which is all she had back at her dorm  driving in the car, i feel as though i am on long island, for the sea feels like it is around the corner.  but it is middle tennessee and i am driving around mtsu.  the rolling hills are like the dunes at the beach. i am certain there is water nearby.  now it is night and i try to park the car but any spots are unsatisfactory, including next to the partially disassembled white minivan.  before this i have been driving to the "60 cafe", which is the twenty-four hour dining facility here on the sprawling campus.  so called sixty because it is open every minute of the hour.  when i go inside the cafeteria that is when i return to my room and the first scene above?  no, intervening, the name "bil breyer" repeated over and over to the tune of my alarm clock going off.  also a small dog.  also my uncle mark and aunt pam and someone asking if they were still together. 
3753 20030318073407 Get yer ethnic stereotype on!   In the old Blamey's field next to my parents' house, someone had set up an office suite outside, in the full May sunlight. Rick's friend Howard and I were practicing "adminsistrative assertiveness" for a business class he was taking of the same name.  I was supposed to be portraying an annoying, pushy person who was trying to monopolize Howard's time.  Howard was supposed to use various dissembling techniques, discussed and promoted by this class, to foist me and my problems onto someone else in the organization with less valuable time and more patience.    The scene morphed into the close office of a public school administator.  Someone, an adjunctive therapist or an independent consultant, was trying to talk to us about the need to evaluate one student for special assistance.  At first I was trying to apply the administrative assistance techniques on this person, but then I decided to listen to her.  The student she was discussing was a genius on the basketball court.  He had several skills that he had honed to a near science, and he was only in fifth or sixth grade.  The consultant, however, kepot making semi-racist judgements about the failure of basketball as a moral and ethical sport.    "I mean, I guess it's just not  inherent  in basketball to have moral integrity," she said.    "What are you talking about?  That doesn't make sense," I said to her, but she would not explain her position.  She only smiled knowingly.    The office changed again; the dimensions remained the same; only more students and people my own age piled in.  The office was dimly lit by overcast daylight filtering in a window. Three or four Jpaanese women, exchange students , were in the office eating lunch.  One had spilled a big bunch of maple syrup on the table and I was trying to point out the paper towels hanging ont he wall behind her, so she could mop the syrup up.    "Futomaki, futomaki," I kept saying, though I knew that was some type of sushi.    "Ah, syrup," said the woman, following my gesturing hand to another big pitcher of syrup, which she promptly began pouring all over her lunch.    "To-ko," said the woman next to me. "That's "towel"."  I tried repeating it but couldn't pronounce it correctly. Someone was talking about boundaries between countries.  A Scottish man was talking about the barbed wire they put up along the  Scottish coast , between Scotland and Ireland, "so that swine and other livestock cae not escape or swim over."  He was showing us photos of peoople who had washed up on their shores.   "Once," he said, "a  Japanese warlord  landed up on our shores.  He was long-haired, with fierce talons and horns"--I could see a picture of the warlord as he spoke; he had some sort of headress on, with long curved talon-like goat horns on it.    "He landed on our shores and was killed, right there."  The Japanese women were fascinated.  The one who spilled her syrup asked, with interest, when he came over: "I would know his ancestors and report to them," she said.  "I'd like to say thirty years ago,' our forthright Scottish ambassador replied.  "But it was two."    Later, I was leaving a theater with my mom.  The next show was about to begin--the latest in an infinite series of  Home Alone  movies, this one featuring Macauluy Culkin as an absent-minded parent, and his own child as the star.  Somehow my mom and I had wound up halfway up the aisle, and my father was waiting for us in the aisle we'd originally sat in, unaware that we were waiting from him up the aisle.   When we caught up with him, he told us that he'd met up with Kate "and her rock-star boyfriend."  Kate was supposed to have made clothes for some festival we would both attend.    
3759 20030913005008 I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town  But never let them say I'm mean or small    9/10  Walking up and down the endless staircase, hung from nowhere to nowhere like an impossible feat of architecture or an M.C. Escher dream of infinity.  The stairway itself bracketed to the walls, forty feet above or below any idea of solid ground--and the stairs so positioned that I could never tell whether I was ascending or descending--just an endless series of steps and platforms I had to leap between.  I was shaking and dizzy.  Then people joined me, Rick among them.  Then I was laying in a bed with Rick at my feet and someone else beside me.  The glass bottomed boat gliding down the wide and surprisingly clear and swift-flowing Mississippi.  "Look," I said.  "The true river."  An enormous log floated by--at first I thought it was a pylon of metal that had snapped off the bridge we were passing under--Someone said that they thought it was fastened to the riverfloor.  But I clocked it as it moved alongside our boat, swept along by the river's current.  A small boy was looking excitedly out the window.  I noticed something different in our motion through the water--the boat was meeting with less resistance, moving more swiftly.  I realized we were on the edge of a steep drop-off and for a moment I thought they had installed a canal along this section of the river, and that we were going to stop as they filled up the next lock.    Then I realized we were on the edge of an enormous waterfall.  The cascade of the waterfall was held in by steel beams.  Our boat kept gliding onward until it was entirely over the edge and hanging suspended in air, like Wile E. Coyote when he'd run off a cliff in pursuit of the Road Runner.  Then we descended sharply, straight down like an amusement park ride or a load of sand onto a barge.  My stomach flipped and turned.  In the airport lobby where we were transported after landing, a band was playing.  The members were all people I thought I knew, and the cellist was Sarah Clark, tuning her instrument down a half-step so she could play, she claimed, ten octaves higher.  In a roomful of people I was loudly denouncing the current state of computer-based fonts.  I reserved special vehemence for what I called "the fuckin' Russian avant-garde film family of fonts".  Then I realized there were children--Beth Gilmore's children--in the room, and I was embarassed to have cursed in front of them.  I was wearing the Little Italy shirt Bryce had picked up for me in New York--only it had turned to a beautiful end-of-day yellow-gold.  The sun was setting, red-orange, behind a map of Little Italy and the silhouette of the Twin Towers.  9/11  I had backed the car into a tight spot--someone's wall-to-wall carpeted office space, with a tiny turnaround for golf-cart size cars.  I explained to my dad that I wanted to do a thirty-point turn, but he and his friend Harry forbade me to do so.  Alex Budnitz had a book of pictures of his friend--including several of his girlfriend, one with the caption "Lucy doesn't have great legs, but she's working on it."  I was going to Will's Brooklyn apartment with sis Kate.  We had to step through the piles of boxes and butcher shop refuse in the garage that led to the back entrance to his place.  There was the bad smell of the halal meat market, and two IVs of cow blood piled on the floor.  Kate and I had come bearing some sort of gift, a poster from Hatch of a singer Will loved.  The stairway to Will's door was strangely compressed. It was early afternoon and when Will stumbled to the door he told us to wait just a bit, he still had to get dressed.    I was scrubbing and scrubbing my feet, which were dirty and smelled like wet dogs. 
3777 20030309111208 the reign of boxes  Two women are stocking by the frozen food section, which runs along a wall immediately to your right as you walk in.  There are boxes everywhere, however, and some are stacked impoosibly high--fifteen of twenty feet.  They are teetering precariously, and there are two massive towers catty-cornered so that the entire entrance to the aisle is blocked, except for a little entryway I can just squeeze through.    I think to myself that it may be wiser to just walk down the aisle next to this one all the way to the end, then walk u the blocked aisle from the other direction.  But even as I'm thinking this I'm squeezing past the boxes.  The two women unpacking stuff are talking loudly; they don't even pay attention to me.  One larger woman does look up at me, annoyed, but she goes back to what she's doing.    As I'm squeezing through, though, I realize the boxes are starting to fall.  They are falling from the tops of the two towers, which seem to be projectile launching them in slow motion; it is a rain of boxes.  The women are still just putting away frozen food packages.  "I'm gonna offer this bag up"--here the larger woman holds up a family size pack of peas--"for sale this week."  I'm trying to help the larger meaner woman pick up the boxes, but she's scowling at me and claiming that she will press criminal charges against me.  I grow indignant. "No, I will not give you my name and address," I say, "until I can speak to a lawyer."  I run outside and into my car and drive away fast.    Suddenly I'm in a high school area.  I see Ari Kramer walk by--he looks as though he's been crying.  "Rough day?" I ask.  "Sort of," he says.    Mr. Babcock, my fish-eyed chorus teacher, pokes his head in th doorframe.  "Alesandra, can I speak to you?" he asks.  I realize he wants to talk to me about the Wal-Mart box collapse, so I walk into his office.  "Do you mind if I write things down?" I ask.  He doesn't, so I write down my account of what happened.   Later on, Rick and I were driving.  Suddenly, a rapidly opening-and-closing garage door materialized on the highway.  I was nervous and didn't know how to drive through it, so we sat there with the car in park for about ten minutes until I worked up the courage to dart under it while it was open.  As we drove under it it stopped moving.  My mom and I were in a large city scrambling to catch our plane.  I had nearly all my possessions with me.  I helped an old woman move herself and her bicycle down a steep curb.  My mom went on ahead and in my haste to catch up with her I left some things behind--an old blanket and some health food.  We were trying to catch a plane. I walked through a door and into Kate's Paperie.  I was searching for my mom and couldn't find her.  I thought I saw Bryce momentarily by the checkout.  I walked outside and my mom waved at me from across a four lane road.  "Hurry," she said.  "We have fifty minutes to catch our plane."  Later I'm in elementary school and I'm somwhere between a teacher and a student.  I'm talking to Mrs. Rodriguez, the old counselor at Landrum.  She and some other students are trying new foods developed by the school chef.  I am trying to get together some postcards people have written in response to the Wal-mart incident.  A secretary comes in with a palm pilot attached to a cell phone. "You've been sitting on this for two months," the secretary says.  I don't know what I've been sitting on; there's no message that I can see on the palm pilot. But I pick up the phone and answer in my best teacher's voice, though I can hardly remember the name of the school I'm teaching at.  It's Ari Kramer's dad, and he wants to have a meeting with me to discuss his son's behavior.  But I have a plane to catch.  
3801 20030728123607 dream of 7/27 When I went down to the grassy meadow, I saw a stream flowing beyond a dirt path that followed the course of the stream, off to the right. Beyond the stream there was a wider river, fenced off with a latching metal gate of the sort used for cattle pens.  I was walking down towards the creek when a bristly sharp-toed javelina came hurtling through the woods, bounding over the small creek and hurling itself across the latched gate.  It was only about two feet long and a foot and a half high, but it was moving with the ferocity of a rabid football, and its teeth were gnashing at the air.  It had false tusks growing from its bottom gumline--large incisors that started below its other teeth and grew outwards to curl over its top lip.  No sooner had it bounded over the fence than another javelina--bigger this time, but with the same coarse features and explosive energy--hurtled after it, bounding over the fence even more quickly.  In a single, unbroken series of hops it emerged, cleared the small stream and the fence, landed a small distance from the fence, cleared it, and bounded over the river.  I was scared of the javelinas.  We realized that there was a set of traintracks elevated above the river.  Then I was alone and I realized that my blue backpack was sitting on the opposite shore.  The water was rising as though the tide were coming in; I felt like I did when I was little and fell asleep at the beach, many feet from the sea, and woke to find the water lapping at my feet.  I was going to cross the water to get my bag before water engulfed it but then I saw the javelinas bounding up again, and in the water the lazy fierce primordial eye of a crocodile, floating just below the surface level of the river.  So I had to go around on foot.  So I did.  The dirt path looped around, forming a natural bridge over the water.  Ont he oposite bank, a vagrant family had set up a makeshift homesite of carboard and rags on the platform along the train tracks.  I walked through it.  The children were playing in front of it, the sunlight making dappled patterns on their chests as they ran in and out of shadow.  The mother came out, eyeing me suspiciously, and told the kids to get ready to return their library books.   Outside the library, darkeness fallen, on a deserted city street far from the ramshackle house of cardboard, the train platform, the flying javelinas, my submerged bag with all my sketches inside.  From the back window of a station wagon, where I sat riding backwards, I saw the vagrant woman and her children again, standing on a street corner waiting for the bus or about to begin the long walk home, I didn't know which.  And someone inside the library, my dad maybe, had trusted me with a message for the ragged lady, but I hadn't been able to find her until just then, when I myself was already leaving.  I yelled at the driver to stop the car, and when they didn't do so fast enough I jumped out and ran to the woman, who, startled, pulled her children close to her and drew back.  "There's a message for you," I said, "inside, in the library.  Somebody is on the phone and they are still there, waiting for you."  She stared at me blankly.  "It's important," I said.  The library had been the only place where someone could leave a message for this lady.  "Please go," I begged her.  Wordlessly, without any other acknowledgement besides the act of turning with her children and setting off towards the library, she disappeared intot he black night.  Later a small small child, proportioned like a miniature adult, was making too much noise in the auditorium.  I put my hand before his mouth.  Sarah had found someone else's glasses, and we were putting them up before crowds of people trying to determine whose they were. 
3843 20061009111414 10/08 - we had to leave the manor house, and quickly, but i realized once we got inthe car that i had forgotten my viola upstairs.  the driver and i communicated through eye signs.  i was dropped off at the door of the manor house.  when i went inside into the marble-floored reception room i saw only a blank marble wall in front of me where the stairs had been. whatever bad force had caused us to flee the house so suddenly was already at work.  but i tried to scale the wall anyway, realizing as i did so that small sandstone steps were foring beneath me.  i struggled to get upstairs.  we were back in the car, a group of us.  i was going to meet up with the driver of the car later.  i was dropped off at the back of my nanny and pop-pop's oldplace.  i ran through the hedge and saw all of the housing developments, but as though they had been built in the '20s or '30s instead of the '50s.  i sought out the driver.  he was laying in the grass on the colelge campus.  he looked like a young version of my freshman year english professor.  he was thinking about math problems in his head and it was as though i could read his mind.  the way he thought about math problems was like telling a story.  i was about to ask him what he was thinking, and to clarify my statement by saying that he should do whatever he thought best (he was concerned about "choosing a major"), when suddenly some people in white lab coats came over and started taking measurements of his feet with large calipers.  when i asked them what they were doing they tried to deflect my question, saying that they were doing some research on biometrics.  i said that i had done some labwork inthat same area, but we had always cleared permission with our subjects first.  my suspicions were slightly alarmed but even more so when i saw them filming our every move -- not mine so much as the young man's.  they asked him for his biographical information and he explained that he was "an eighth grade math and computer science major, now a freshman in college".  i was hoping they wouldn't ask me about my background becuase until this point i hadn't realized that the young man was so chronologically young.  when they did turn the camera to me i tlaked about growing up near the water on long island, and studying antrhopology and psychology.  "she is emotional, a feeler," one of the scientists said, "we don't really need her data."  i was separated from the young man, and i was inside a dark long wood shed with two walls and two open ends.  i could see the scientists continue their interrogation.  suddenly i realized what was happening, or, rather, realized that they were going to try to use the boy for evil purposes.  a fairy army was marching through the forest and the boy's presence would somehow make their forces near invincible.  i had to warn him.  10/09: late to the school, san benito, now called "barn".  i left gigantic pumpkins boiling in big vats for rick and his family to stuff and eat -- i took out leftovers, of which we had only a little, for them to stuff inside.  my mom drove me to school a new back way, much quicker than the way i normally took. once inside i saw shana kohnstamm  arriving at the same time, in her boyfirend's stick shift car which she did not know how to drive.  but once inside, while we talked and i thought about what else could have gone int he stuffed pumpkins, someone told us, "did you know you are late?"  we didn't, so we hurried to mrs. armstrong's class.  it was already 9:45 am, and we were supposed to have been inside by 9:30. "hello, alesandra," mrs. armstrong said.  on the board two people from high school, jen giorlando and amanda bellafiore, maybe, were placing scancion marks above an unknown line from shakespeare: "rosalind, you flat-foot wench ..."  i talked with laura sobik.   
3851 20060629092007 There was Sartre (he was just about 5'6" or so, with dark hair and strange piercing roving eyes).  A bunch of us were in the woodshed that needed cleaning out.  We were hauling stuff around and I desperately wanted to ask Sartre about Simone de Beauvoir -- what she was like as a person, what Sartre's true opinions of her and her thinking were, I really just wanted honest first-hand talk, not necessarily directed to any end -- but Sartre was there with another woman and I felt uncomfortable discussing de Beauvoir.  The woodshed looked beautiful, a change from the dingy and cluttered space we had entered into.  Now it was still dim, but the single bare bulb on the ceiling shone warmly on a clean-swept floor and white spackle buckets stacked neatly to one side. Everything stored in there, previously jumbled together without any organization, was now easily accessible.  We had thrown very little away becasue it all seemed mostly potentially valuable.  We had just organized it.  Going through the strange amusement park-like outdoor area, seeing the netting enclosed spaces I at first thought were temporary hotels -- actually batting cages or bouncy ball pits, depending on the need.  I am with a young child, a group actually, who are acting destructively. I've got to gethtem outside so we can catch a ferry back to some mainland, and also so we can talk about respectful actions.  THe one kid I am physically nearest too ends up with some kid's baseball helmet in his hands.  We are almost by the exit so I make him go with me to the person taking up tickets.  He shoves the hat towards her, umbles something that gets her mad.  I step in to explain how he found the hat int he bouncy ball pit, how we would appreciate if she could turn it in to the lost and found, or let us know where it is.  "It's supposed to be out front by the telephones, but it hasn't been open since 2000," she says, taking the helmet.  We thank her.  On the way out I am asking the boy if he could tak about the difference between the way he interacted with the girl (her nametag said "Rhonda" or "Irrhonda") and the way I did but perhaps he is not understanding me because he doesn't even remember what girl I'm talking about.  Ont he other side we're walking past a huge port with big ships but because it is a long time after our bota was supposed to sail we think we've missed it.  Eventually I spot my dad -- he may have waited for us. On the boat sailing we see Laura Sobik, another woman with her spine visibile through her shirt, other men and women in a gym -- I start repainting an oil painting, just adding some bits.  THere is a sold piece of my mo's with the title -- "To My Friend, Who Loves These Spaces Too and Is Aware They May All Soon Be Gone".  I see only the back of the canvas with its rough sketch of a harbor scene.  The people int he gym and the oil painting of an aboriginal woman in straw hat surrouinded by green and yellow flowers -- all are part of a television series called "Makeovers without Surgery" -- except the word for makeover starts with a "p" somehow.  There is a small funny baby and her older sister. I am trying to make funny farting noises ont eh baby but someone's hands are over my mouth.  Some gathering (wedding?) at my Nanny's old place.  Looking through my Nanny's old house, everything stripped from the walls in anticipation of it going on market.  The back room where the washer and dryer used to be in larger and has a lead in that is walled but has no roof.  There are a strange set of stpes going down tot he basement that suddenly are cut-off.  There is no back wall.  We are thinking of buying the house but I am trying to figure out if all our art will fit in it.  We would have to make renovations to make this room useable but I am inriuged by the set of blocked stairs I never saw. 
3864 20060605101208 someone was waving to me, i thought, so i waved back, but then they were not waving at me but at their girlfriend and this for some reason made me feel embarrassed.  this was at a big party at our place, but it was not 306 fairfax but a different house.  i saw sean keane a long way off and mouthed silently to him "where's corie?"  then i said it a little louder, but then i could see corie.  i was supposed to drive her somewhere else.  she came over to where i was scrambling down the rock wall.  except the wall was made of long thin slabs of limestone, but the slabs themselves were not very deep, so the weight of my body as i tried to lower myself down on them was pulling htem out, leaving me no place to grab.  i decided to abandon this pursuit and climb back up but i was faced with the same problem.  finally i hoisted myself up unceremoniously and pulled myself over the edge on my side kind of like a beached whale.  corie had solved her ride problem.  we talked about how, if a compassionate stranger volunteers to do something for you versus a true friend - the burden of fulfillment does not truly apply to the stranger.  hence better to accept a favor froma  friend.  kim needed to check soemthing ont he computer at work, but i was embarrassed because i had been browsing the internet instead of doing the work i needed to do.  most embarrassingly, my friend had recently told me about a collection of award-winning short stories that i had to read called  adult house keeping .   there was a google search for it up on screen and i didn't want kim to tak it the wrong way.  a lady was coming in just as we were closing to buy three pairs of earrings and pick up a puzzle that she had already bought and paid for.  i knew where the box that held the puzzle was but not what was inside, so i got it for her.  people, or one person, fromt he frist was there talkign about having meetigns three days a week to talk about current projects. people from wolfe woodworking would go.   dr. c the orchestra conductor was there.  his hair was all crazy like beethoven's or listz's.  i felt rather sheepish about something -- perhaps i waslate to rehearsal again?  -- but dr. c was sitting on a stone wall pontificating about various things.  he was turned to me -- "you know another way in which we are similar?" he asked.  i didn't. "is your mom blind as well?" he asked.  i didn't understand his question at first so i asked him to repeat it.  "Is your mom blind?  my mother is."  i said my mom wasn't blind but i asked if his mom was legally blind or fully blind.  but i asked the question in such a way that it was int he present tense.  dr. c said that his mom had been legally blind but that it had gotten progressively more blind until her death. however the point of similarity between our moms was not this but a sort of appreciation of purity of music.  there was a particular time frame dr. c was discussing (not corresponding to actual music history) that both of our moms loved - just before baroque, a time of very little orchestral elaboration, just pure single notes, no harmonies or dissonances.  "tehse all came soon after," dr. c said, "for there turly cannot be music without these dissonances and disassociations ... but my mother loved that period of pure sound before.  she used to take her instrument" -- and here dr.c took what looked like a piece of dried pineapple (?), put it in his mouth like a tuning harp (whatever those things are called), and started playing a baroque style melody -- "and just play away on it, grinning in my face."  he played the whole piece for me in this style. it was night and the sky was dark but filled with stars and dr. c's face was floating somewhat like a constellation in front of my eyes.  this was another way in which we were similar, this detachment that music could cause. 
3880 20061009202807 10/08 - we had to leave the manor house, and quickly, but i realized once we got inthe car that i had forgotten my viola upstairs.  the driver and i communicated through eye signs.  i was dropped off at the door of the manor house.  when i went inside into the marble-floored reception room i saw only a blank marble wall in front of me where the stairs had been. whatever bad force had caused us to flee the house so suddenly was already at work.  but i tried to scale the wall anyway, realizing as i did so that small sandstone steps were foring beneath me.  i struggled to get upstairs.  we were back in the car, a group of us.  i was going to meet up with the driver of the car later.  i was dropped off at the back of my nanny and pop-pop's oldplace.  i ran through the hedge and saw all of the housing developments, but as though they had been built in the '20s or '30s instead of the '50s.  i sought out the driver.  he was laying in the grass on the colelge campus.  he looked like a young version of my freshman year english professor.  he was thinking about math problems in his head and it was as though i could read his mind.  the way he thought about math problems was like telling a story.  i was about to ask him what he was thinking, and to clarify my statement by saying that he should do whatever he thought best (he was concerned about "choosing a major"), when suddenly some people in white lab coats came over and started taking measurements of his feet with large calipers.  when i asked them what they were doing they tried to deflect my question, saying that they were doing some research on biometrics.  i said that i had done some labwork inthat same area, but we had always cleared permission with our subjects first.  my suspicions were slightly alarmed but even more so when i saw them filming our every move -- not mine so much as the young man's.  they asked him for his biographical information and he explained that he was "an eighth grade math and computer science major, now a freshman in college".  i was hoping they wouldn't ask me about my background becuase until this point i hadn't realized that the young man was so chronologically young.  when they did turn the camera to me i tlaked about growing up near the water on long island, and studying antrhopology and psychology.  "she is emotional, a feeler," one of the scientists said, "we don't really need her data."  i was separated from the young man, and i was inside a dark long wood shed with two walls and two open ends.  i could see the scientists continue their interrogation.  suddenly i realized what was happening, or, rather, realized that they were going to try to use the boy for evil purposes.  a fairy army was marching through the forest and the boy's presence would somehow make their forces near invincible.  i had to warn him.  10/09: late to the school, san benito, now called "barn".  i left gigantic pumpkins boiling in big vats for rick and his family to stuff and eat -- i took out leftovers, of which we had only a little, for them to stuff inside.  my mom drove me to school a new back way, much quicker than the way i normally took. once inside i saw shana kohnstamm  arriving at the same time, in her boyfirend's stick shift car which she did not know how to drive.  but once inside, while we talked and i thought about what else could have gone int he stuffed pumpkins, someone told us, "did you know you are late?"  we didn't, so we hurried to mrs. armstrong's class.  it was already 9:45 am, and we were supposed to have been inside by 9:30. "hello, alesandra," mrs. armstrong said.  on the board two people from high school, jen giorlando and amanda bellafiore, maybe, were placing scancion marks above an unknown line from shakespeare: "rosalind, you flat-foot wench ..."  (or was it goldaline? or goldmund?)  i talked with laura sobik.   
3888 20060714135211 (dream of the other night, at the end, when i turned right out of the school complex, suddenly i am not in a car but walking.  many people walk besides beofre and afte rme.  the sky is boiling with storm clouds. we look at the sky and decide as we walk that we will go in the gas station buildings if we need to.  but we have already passed one and as the sky grows darker i wonder when we will turn in.  we are bound to walk until it rains.)  laura sobik somewhere in the background.  we are perhaps the same person.  in the church with my family after sean jewett and i have gone swimming in a lap pool just off the the side aisle.  many people are in there like a waiting room.  in the back o the church on the stone floor behind all the pews my dad and i inspect the potted plants.  some have too much water inside their containers so i find a rectangular plastic pand and am trying to scoop out the water.  i will ahve to make multiple trips to dump the water out.  i empty it int he gravel mulched bed jsut outside the confessional area in an outer courtyard.  nuns and monks and priests are around.  i am saying a prayer to the goddess of the earth when i dump it.  inside i am having a discussion with my mom but it turns into an argument.  we go into the dark bathroom, a large room with brown feeling and one window that lets int the only light, dim, from outside. my mom says something.  i try to hug her but she says "get your hands off my face and body".  sad, i hang my head into the empty bathtub.  my mom comes over and lifts up a disposable razor with which she starts slicing at my wrists.  sarah and i are driving through the subdivisions trying to find another route.  when we get to the suppsoed dead end we realize there is a pass through to the highway.  we go to the left most of the two driveways that offer access. the resident of the house comes out and we are scared that he will yell at us for trespassing on his property but instead he tells us that our car is running too fast and needs to be brought into the shop.  we realize we can't squeeze through the two parked cars.  we go downt he other driveway and make a right onto the highway.  i am int eh car alone and now goign to the left.  it is more rural and when a girl passes on a tractor i ask her the way to the city.  when she points in the direction opposite the one i am going i am not surprised.  i turn around.    the gas station building is burned out.  i look and the buildings everywhere are burned out; the glass int he windows has melted the fires were so hot, and when it cooled it cooled with bubbles in it like warts or boils.  it has a fierce feeling, wounded.  beyond the burned out buildings, the work of riots, the pristine city beyond.    i hear the train coming.  i need to use my hands to operate the brake pedal -- i have to lean down out of my seat -- and also drag my hands along the road to slow the car down in time.  the arm of the rail guard comes down just in front of me after i have stopped.  the cars that stop behind me are pulling off onto the field to our right.  the field is bare and cracked.  i could turn to the left as well, onto the street where tw-way traffic proceeds as usual.  in american artisan, i am telling customers about hte large saltshaker collection.  cynthia is asking me to do some work when i close up shop but i hadn't even come in there to work.  debbie staples passes by with other people.  julie sola talks about massood taj, but she calls him taj, speaking aobut his persecution by police officers and officials. listening to her tell her tale of him seeking her out, asking "should we talk about this here or in franklin?" (they wind up going to franklin), then him telling about the police kicking him out of his apratment and shutting down the whole complex -- these stories seem like workings of paranoid imagination.  
3904 20060707101209 Laura Sobik is getting picked up outside her house, which is right off a busy road, looks kind of like a spanish ranch house.  First she says goodbye to her parents.  Then a guy pulls up in a fancy car.  The guy who gets out is black, looks like a foot ball player, is very courteous to Laura.  She is making faces at her parents because they are making faces about the race of the person picking her up.  Then Laura is not going with that person but with another guy who I am int he car with.  I am laughing because Laura is putting on so many clothes over her fancy dress and shoes: a windbreaker, a winter coat, ski pants, galoshes. THere is snow onteh ground and she is used to northern winters because her family lived full time int he Adirondacks for a while, I realize.  Everyone is getting ready to leave on a plane, perhaps separate planes going separate places.  I alone of all my friends in the room seem concerned with getting my things together.  THe room is big, one long ballroom.  Stuff is everywhere.  I am piling stuff in my small shoulder bag, all I have.  I ask my friend at some point if she thinks I should bring my hiking boots, since I have two pairs in this room and it seems a shame to abandon them completely.  Danielle is the friend now and she says to take them.  At first I am just holding them but I mean to tie them by their laces to my bag.  Laura Sobik and I are rushing down the aisles of the school trying to getto the plane.  She goes one way at first and I think our flight, in terminal six, is th other way, so she turns and we run that way for a bit, but soon we are disoriented and looking at a map realize that she was going in the right direction.  We run back to terminal six and I see my friends in line.  There are a lot of people behind them but they gesture for me to join them mid-way through the line.    I walk down the aisle of a small grocery.  At the end of a short aisle on the extreme side of the store there is a tank with lobsters.  Little kids are pulling them out and running around with them.  The management is getting mad and sending security guards over to chastise the kids.   I am writing an essay on a Judy Blume or Beverly Cleary character.  He is doing similar things to what the small boys in my dream are doing.  I am having trouble writing the essay.  I am trying to use supporting evidence from the story but I am not sure it supports my thesis.  My thesis is that the boy must learn to become more happy in a wider range of situations, but when I try to put in evidence that he is not doing this yet,or that he is trying to transistion to this, I do not think my examples support this claim.  I don't want to get a bad grade ont he essay.  I see other essays I have written that have A- on them, and I think about one paper that i wrote that received a B.  There is a large woodenroom with a sunken floor in one part and a drain that you can put a stopper over to take a bath.  I am trying to run the water to take a bath.  Some lady from "Desperate Housewives" owns this bathroom.  The bathroom was just cleaned but we forgot to swab off the stopper and there is dirt and hair onit.  At first it doesn't cover the drain but I move it around until it does and I also rinse it with water. I am in my old room at my parents' house.  We are trying to transcribe music, or rather I have been asked a question about a particular piece so I am singing it in my head.  As I sing it I see myself inthe mirro walking past each instrument inthe peice.  I am walking past the brass section.  First a combination saxophone / trombone, adroned with velvet tags like the saint tags that hang.  Then there are other brass isntruments like trumpets playing.  Then a lone string instrument, my viola, a violin really, is playing itself.  I look down to see the bow moving across it by itself and I think that perhaps it is haunted. 
3905 20030125103807 no further orders   (I woke up in the middle of the night...actually around four a.m....and tried to convince myself to remember this whole dream, of which unfortunately I can record only this fragment.)  I was at a press conference.  Everyone was dressed in black.  President Bush was announcing his appointments to his Cabinet of Stupidity.   What's That, Lassie?   There was a big hill inside a glass-ceilinged student commons area.  Two dogs (collie-type but with golden retriever coloring) were running down the hill trying to apprehend another, who they thought was an intruder.    They nipped at him but did not attack.  Someone was filming the scene for a movie.  I thought it was very unrealistic and I was telling them what a border collie would do under those circumstances.  Walking along, I wandered into an area on the other side of the hill where (surprise, surprise) my family was hanging out.  My mom was talking to my long-dead great-Grandma Green, who was resplendent in a gold turban and big beaded lucite neckalce.    I moved on past these women to where my Nanny was sitting at one of about ten round tables.  She summoned me to her and told me to look for a photo of her and Mario.  Some other relatives at the table dismissed her request as crazy..."She doesn't know any Mario," they said, and puzzlingly, "Her brother Mario died when she was a baby."  (My Nanny never had a brother Mario.)  But I went to look in the pile of papers and photo albums beneath a tall and shadowy china cabinet.  All these albums were new, so I went into my Nanny's old den/tv room to look some more.    My  cousin Samm  was in there eating Brie and crackers.  Except she had eaten them all, four trays of them, and didn't feel good.  I was looking through old sketchbooks--including the sketchbooks of my cousin Caitlin and my cousin Samm, which I thought were really good--and I was discovering old games, but I couldn't find any photo albums.   Hold Your Fire   I was driving the Malibu with Rick in the passenger seat.  The roads were slick and I had never seen them before, except in another dream.  I was driving a little too fast and kept being surprised by red lights.  We moved from a very commercialized, Bronxified area to a quieter residential area, wooded and near to a harbor.  I made a wrong turn and wound up on the road alongside the harbor.  I parked the car and told Rick to go on--I'd walk to get groceries.    I was trying to remember what I needed to buy as I walked by this large house.  I figured out that it was a sorority house after a woman from my high school, Lilliana Schirippa, walked in reciting the names of people whom I would know who had joined the sorority. Further on down a hill there was another house I wandered into; women there were holding a sorority initiation.  Only it wasn't an initiation so much as an induction of already-existing members--who'd joined at a junior college or something--into another branch of the sorority.  I got roped into talking to one woman back at "headquarters" on the phone.  Her name was Franzy and she was from Chamblee, Georgia--she had a soft Atlanta accent and the connection was bad.  She was saying something about a tree that was going to transform the economy of Chamblee, "she just hoped it would".  Somehow I escaped by handing the phone off to another woman from high school, Sabrina Crespo.  Night was falling and I was walking with   Rick ,  Brandon , and  Arie  up along a ridge just above our house.  I was looking for dry-erase markers because I wanted to draw a tactical map on a white board that we'd found outside the house.  But all I could find were permanent markers.  A man with a tank was patrolling beneath us.  He was going to fire at us, and I was trying to get in touch with a radio controller to tell him that we were not enemy combatants and that the tank should hold its fire.   
3915 20030131073808 Stars of Track and Field   I had seen my sister Sarah, on her long-distance runs, let herself into a massive house atop the hill in the woods behind my parents' home.  So I figured I could do the same.  It was early morning, but the sun had risen to just the above the treeline and was dazzling the ground.  I let myself into the massive house, which turned out to be my Aunt Barbara's place.  I ran up the wooden staircase--entered an enormous hallway--ran down the hallway to another stairwell--hopped down the stairwell, jumping over steps, into the foyer below--slid across hallway carpets and repeated the whole process again.   I did this about four or five times and then realized that my aunt's entire family was in the house, sleeping.  I felt very awkward--actually, I felt like an intruder.  So I checked to make sure that the door was still unlocked--it had a latch just under the doorknob that you could turn to lock it--and then ran out the door.  Behind my aunt's house the land fell off sharply--it looked like the ridge in the woods behind my parents' house where developers put in a bunch of condiminiums more than a decade ago, then cut off the tops of all the trees surrounding the homes so that they could be called "harbor-view properties".  Snow lay on the ground, so brilliant in the sunlight it was almost blinding.  It was so deep I had difficulty running through it, and I was considering just sledding down it on my back.  I could hear a security alarm going off in my aunt's house; somehow I'd triggered it.  I had run to the street beyond my parents' house.  I was running up and down it frantically hoping to pretend, if anyone were to apprehend me, that I had been running here all morning.  But I realized that I had probably left footprints all over, in the snow and on the floor of my aunt's house.   I was puzzled by a dream, stayed with me all day in 1995   My sister Kate had almost gone on a bender, she admitted to me--she'd wound up in Hawaii, somehow, and from there thought about just going on to Tunisia and then India.  But something stopped her.  Now, instead, she was in a coffeeshop with me, talking about going to work and the boy that she had just dumped and the girls she had tried to kiss.   No garbage trucks to hold me down   In an old school auditorium, we were rehearsing for a play.  First, however, we were supposed to hang an art show--work that had been done in community art and creative writing classes.  I was trying to help my mom's friend Nancy hang some copper sculpture pieces and some poetry she had made.  I was also trying to finsh several print blocks.  I put them aside for a moment, though, to hang out with my Nanny on the plane.  The plane turned out to be nothing more than two long clusters of folding chairs, two rows of three chairs across, with a long aisle in between them, set up in a field across from a harbor.  My Nanny had discovered someone on the plane she thought I should know--a professor at a school I had never heard of.  I didn't know her, but the woman sitting next to me, a student, had done some archival research with her.  I knew I had spent over an hour on the plane.  The sun was setting; it felt like summer in New York.  But as I walked back to the school to check on rehearsal it grew very dark--it felt like a winter night.  Garbage trucks were leaving the area where we had hung the art show--all the work had been taken down.  I couldn't see my print blocks anywhere.  I checked the dumpster and at first I thought that I saw them--but it was just a strangely-positioned piece of styrofoam.   I was over an hour late for rehearsal.  The auditorium was an eighth of a coliseum, swaddled in heavy velvet.  We were just reading through the script; they were almost through.  I sat with someone to look at their script--my unfinished blocks and my script were together, wherever that might be.

3934 20061113093608 store that was a library  rare brocade and a silk kimono checked out, putting back in return rack -- but some items near this rack also for sale -- so i move the returns more neatly to the return rack  a book on transforming clothes from the '80s into "stylish fashions for the co-ed".  in relaity it is just cutting and gluing old polyester / silk dresses toeach other using a glue made of sprite and one other substance, then adding on other representative 80s jackets and bottoms.  on the bottom floor there are spray paint stencils in gold by andee rudloff on the ground.  there is one of a chicken woman.  looking up "wardrobe" in the library card catalog, still in wooden cabinets, trying to understand its filing system.  i can't find the "women's interest" section -- just around the corner the tennessee history, the serious "men's subjects" of history and war.  i go around the side of a low table.  there, long books on ancient history and the colonial period in tennessee.  ujulie sola is there, by the greek language books.  "it's all greek to me," she says, and i say, "even after several months, julie?  i'm ashamed of you!", jokingly.  they are trying to close up the library, so i quickly shut the alost empty drawer, marked "W-X-Y-Z", from the round card catalog almost at the end of the room, which is a replica of the elementary school library.  a woman grad student is leaving in front of me and another lady catches up with her, asks how she's been.  the one grad student hasn't been able to get work done.  we are driving in a car away fromt eh library library.  the woman is talking about how she can't really do the job she's been forced into, leading the pep band for what sounds like middle school age kids.  her child had just afew months back broken his chest and his heart would be forever affected, including affecting whether or not he would be able to travel to other climates or altitudes.  earlier in the large audiotorium, about to sing at some quasi-TFA gathering, the white folk on one side of the room begin to sing before the mixed congregation on the other side.  the song is "amazing grace" but the whtie folk are singing it without any soul, not to the known tune of "amazing grace" but to another,much more subdued hymn.  a solosit fromthe congregation looks over the space betweent he groups and says, "that's not how we sing it."  he starts singing and the crowd gets hushed.  but when i am singing along quietly with him i get shushed too.  natalie myles from the rgv tfa corps gives me a newspaper clipping about her congregation to read aloud.  later we are doing yoga on mats and we are supposed to share stories of recovery.  brandon is next to me and he is about to share a story of how he had broken his back but had been healed.  sarah is on the other side of me and i wonder if she will tell her story as well.  we are in a hotel type room and cris alonso is getting ready to return to mexico / guatemala.  danielle is there, trying to comfort her.  there is a sorrow to her return because of the loss fo someone.  danielle has written a poem that is beautiful and ends with "and pablo will be there, still, in the waves below" -- somehow this is not cris's current pablo, but another who was killed in struggle for equality.  but though the poem is beautiful and a rallying cry one can see that it is not what cris needs to hear, ultimately -- she needs to go back and live there, that's the type of poetry she understands.  i give her a hug.  she is bringing her luggage outside as i talk with danielle -- then i walk outside with danielle.  "is someone down there?" she asks, pointing to a box like figure outside, inteh already bright early morning light.  it looks kind of like my viola case and i realize it is -- that i've left it out there all night.  sometime my cousin melissa was walking -- my aunt madeline present somehow.  driving through brush land.
3938 20030202093008 ice age coming   I woke up singing "Idioteque" and "Optimistic" by Radiohead.  How you can rise up singing these songs, I am not sure.    Earlier, in a large sunny open field, people were standing around in groups completing art pieces.  There were about twenty people on our "team". Across the way, some other group was making a large sculpture out of about twenty garbage cans fastened together in a line with twine and plastic.  We wanted to finish before any other group--particularly the garbage can group--did, because we had to walk our piece, once completed, to a spot some five miles away to display it.  We wanted to make sure we had a good spot to display it, because once properly installed our piece would be over thirty feet long.  We each grabbed a portion of the piece and started to walk.  Each person was carrying a plastic grocery bag with half-filled beer bottles in it, looped together with the nylon woven polystraps and buckles sometimes used on commercially-shipped packages.  The bags, linked themselves, served to link us all together.  Yet people kept moving in different directions, not thinking of the way the group should be moving as a whole.  (People frequently would set off walking around a tree, for example, not realizing that, if they did that, other people would slam directly into the tree.)  I'd taken off my shoes; a bad idea, because we were walking down a crude road, past a farm, and I had to walk through mud and slop.  We got to the main road (the terrain so far mirrored the layout of the land by the harbor near my parents' home)  and we had to decide which way to walk next.  Some people were suggesting walking along Jericho Turnpike; others suggested "Canal Road" (the popular name for Riverside Drive), which ran along an old river.  Neither of these sounded particularly appealing.  It was night; we were twenty people bound together by nylon polystraps and plastic bags full of alcohol; everyone was dressed in dark colors; there were no sidewalks along either of these roads, and no streetlights along the stretch of road on which we stood.  Somebody suggested taking a car with three people in it.  I hadn't realized we could take cars--I volunteered mine, and another person volunteered theirs.  Yet people from the group had already wandered off in the wrong direction down the dark road.  I called them back; I had a vision of them getting hit by a school bus.  Yet next we were on that school bus.  Somebody on the bus was getting very sick.  People had been feeding small children rat poison, and it was turning them into large rats with human-like faces.  I got off the bus and tried to enter one of the art classrooms from my middle school.  There were rows of computers nd I went to the only available one to look up antidotes for rat posion.  But the teacher was questioning what I was doing, and somebody had put all these strange icons on the desktop that I had to physically remove with my hands, as though they were  Colorforms , before I could do anything else.  But by then I was outside in somebody's backyard, talking to my mom.  My sister Sarah (as she was when she was eight years old) had been poisoned and was very sick.  She was stretched out asleep in a large old empty enamel tub in the corner of the yard.  I was to go over to her, take her temperature, and decide if she needed any asprin.  I had been the last peson to use the thermometer, I knew, and I had forgotten to swab it with rubbing alcohol after I had used it.  Now there was nothing with which to sterilize it.  Above the tub there was a small medicine chest where I was supposed to find asprin.  But all I could find were out-of-date prescriptions. Sarah's forehead felt warm but not burning;  but she kept spitting out the thermometer so I couldn't get her accurate temperature.      You can try the best you can  If you try the best you can  The best you can is good enough   
3957 20030530094607 freud has a field day   UPDATE: I had found some promotional material put out by the petroleum industry in the fifties.  "Petroleum Jelly, the Wonder By-Product", it read.  There were detailed explanations of rather far-fetched uses for vaseline.  One section included strange pictures of different colored teeth and gums.  "For easier flossing of troublesomely tight crowns and caps," the caption read, "why not apply petroleum jelly to your dental floss."  The pictures of disembodied jaws and teeth were vey bizarre.  We were standing outside our Nashville house.  Its lawn had somehow been stripped bare.  Suddenly I realized we had lots of sandy soil beneath all our grass.  Also, the brick house next door was gone.  Our house sat on a little rise, while the one-story ranch that sat in the property next to us was in a hollow, heavily shaded by large trees.  We saw our neighbors and I realized they were acquaintances from college.  They were going to drive us to the laundromat.  As we were trying to park in the parking lot, the driver kept swiping into the car next to us.  The driver knew the owner, Kisha, of the club where we were hanging the next Untitled show.    When we went inside, what we had expected to be a laundromat turned out to be a dance hall/club.  On stage, the last act was finally getting ready to play.  I looked up when a clear, teacher-like voice said, "Are you ready to rock?"  On stage were perhaps eight or nine members of a middle-aged woman band, all arrayed in variations of the middle-aged woman flowing top and bottom in brightly colored silk/cotton/wrinkle-free rayon look.    One woman, the original questioner of the audience, had a large (probably two- or three-year old) clinging to her waist, occassionally shouting out along with the song in a beautiful and disconcertingly (for a small child) clear voice.  The name of the band, or the acronym they kept exhorting the audience to shout out, over and over again, was C.R.A.M.--Children Raised by alternative Means (or Moms, I could never quite hear which).  The moms, most of whom, once I looked for closely, had some sort of child around them, kept taking turns singing lead.  Finally,, the turn passed to the androgynous-looking bassist.  The bassist had a dirty blond mullet, straggly chin hairs, cutoff jeans and a concert tee, and bad posture.  You couldn't really see the bassist's face, and when the basist tried to sing it was painful.  The bassist stopped mid phrase and begged the other bandmates to take over, and when they had done so, the basist turned back to the wall and its solitary bass.  My friend Danielle and I were deciding not to go to the dance party.  We needed to find our friends.  We walked in heavy, dark tinted glass doors to a long dark-tinted hallway.  The day was cloudy and overcast, though it was really night.  We found Arie and Brandon sitting at a round table, and we went off down the hallway to find Rick.  Arie and Brandon wanted to to play Trivial Pursuit, and Danielle and I agreed to play.  Brandon was trying to waltz.  Somewhere later, I was looking at a contemporary map.  The map of Europe was completely different.  All the countries had been moved around. The USSR still existed, but it was the size of a pea and almost on the Atlantic Ocean.  Turkey was enormous, but the whole point of the map was to show its many ethnic factions, and how at any moment they might splinter the country into many tiny groups.  The upstairs tub was very full.  Somebody was having an argument about the opressive nature of bondage.  Suddenly I was going to have a dentist appointment in my upstairs bathroom.   "I'm eighty-three, you know," my dentist kept saying, while his youthful looking wife/assistant smiled and patted his hand.  Then I realized that we were also hanging an art show in my 83-year-old dentist's office that evening.  That's why we had to have an appointment in the upstairs bathroom.  
3966 20030607123807 soylent green is made of people   In the supermarket, bundles of tied-up, greasy-grey meat were traveling along a silver conveyor belt, the kind found in college cafeterias where you send your trays and dishes back to the kitchen to be washed.  Small toddlers, too, were standing on the belt like stunned and helpless cattle.  One girl in particular, about two years old but tall for her age, was winking her blue eyes and shaking her golden, curly-haired head at us.  She seemed incredibly lively and intelligent.  The girl in front of her seemed more aware of her upcoming fate.  She was whimpering, and when she reached the end of the belt where an aproned and hairnetted attendent, clothes spattered with blood, stood with open arms ready to catch her, she fell to her feet and refused to march forward.  But the belt carried her on anyway.  "You do know what that meat is made of, don't you?" I asked the friend with whom I was walking.  She was holding one of the greasy balls of meat, wrapped in twine and about the size of a plastic shopping bag filled with clothes.  "I know," she said.  "But we need it."  I wondered what people would bring their own children to be made into meat.  Earlier in the dream I was trapped, along with a bunch of other people, in a place that had started out as a summer camp.  Now, it seemed, it had turned into an internment camp.  We were subjected to ridicule, to beatings and hard labor.  We were not allowed contact with our families, or really, to any degree, with each other.  One day we organized.  When all of the staff was in one of their meetings, where they all sat in long black robes listening to their leader, also dressed in a long black robe, we were to sprint past the temporary guards who watched after us those idle half-hours.  We would sneak through the very meeting room itself, which was the only place with direct accesss to outside. Outside, we would disperse.  Maybe one of us would make it to the outside to tell the rest of the world what was going on, or to come back with more force with which to rescue others.  As we slipped through the meeting hall--one of the members of our group had a moose head on, inexplicably--the leader caught sight of our shadows.  "Fire," he told the crowd, his voice rising in malice and anger.  Somehow he worked the word "fire" into the speech he was giving. I was trying to warn the people in the room to move faster, as we had already been discovered, but they were already being shot at.  Outside we scattered in all directions.  We were throwing frisbees and nerf footballs to distract our captors.  I reached a fence along the back property line.  It was covered with barbed wire but I was trying to climb it anyway.  There was a tree next to it and I figured I could maybe launch myself over using the tree. Young members of the community, twenty and younger, were trying to help me despite being of our captor's tribe.  A guard came over.  "She'll see you in that tree," someone said.  "Nah," I said.  "I'll hide."  But I could tell she would see me.  Indeed she did.  My allies convinced her to go get reinforcements--they would keep guard on me, they said.  I leapt out of the tree the moment she turned her back.  I'd noticed something I hadn't before--a hole torn in the fence.    "Goodbye," I siad.  "Thank you."  I didn't think I would fit through but I wriggled by just in time.  Then I was off, running, with guards in pursuit.  But I lost them among buses and office buildings.  The interstate was beyond, and I thought about running beside it or even hitchhiking, but suddenly I found myself walking with Rick up side alleys.  I didn't feel safe--if people spotted me and realized where I'd been they would turn me in for cash.  We kept running up side alleys and ducking down when we saw people.  Rick had seven dollars in Sacajewea coins, and I had forty-five cents.  If we could make it on a bus to Florida, we'd be safe.       
3979 20030212075208 I'm Dreaming of a Bizarre Christmas   In the dream I had just before two a.m., when I woke up with a start, forgetting, for a moment, where I was--in this dream I was in upstate New York visiting my Granny Anne. Only Granny Anne's house was a large darkened garage or warehouse, with one large cluttered front display room and a single dim light source somewhere off in a small stock room in back.  More than anything it gave the appearance of some sort of repair shop, with a long, dimly-lit counter behind which my grandmother and I stayed. My Aunt Chris was there, but passing through only momentarily (and peripherally) on her way to work.  Indeed, my grandmother was acting as though she was going to leave, too, but only until my aunt left.  Then my granny came out from the back room and started talking with me.  She was very interested in a bag I had wth me.  It was from a year-round Christmas shop I'd stopped in on my way to see her.  There was an ornament inside but the real marvel was the bag itself; the size of a large gift bag, it was adorned on both sides with working Christmas lights, a small Christmas tree, and several stufed (fake) mice.  In another room--this one a more traditional sitting room, well-lit and decorated, in a subdued way, for Christmas--there was a small Christmas tree somehow folded into a corner.  There was a photo of my Aunt Pam, about twenty years ago, and a copy of an anthropological report she had done on gender roles in my immediate nuclear family's Christmas customs.  Then I woke up, suddenly--then went back to sleep--and this morning remembered, surprisingly, this part of my dream.   There was a never-ending house of sorts--our neighbor Ruth's garage had a secret upper story that had never been entered into since her husband's death--and very rarely even when he was alive.  Our house had an unexplored attic and basement.  Somebody made a   card , point value (e!), that challenged the person it was played upon to explore the secret rooms.  Then they played it on me, and I was confused because I didn't understand how one could have a card worth (e!), but I was glad because I had been going to explore the rooms no matter what.    The Teacher Never Told You Anything But White Lies, Part Two  I was walking with my mom through our high school, but it didn't look like our high school--each wing was its own small town, responsible for town services like water, waste disposal, utilities.  One town's water and sewer lines were leaking; it was the town where my high school global studies teacher, Mr. Fiorelli, taught.  He said his students were already on it, and I believed him.  Apparently I was a teacher, or at least a part-time instructor, at this school.  While I was out, my substitute had written many referrals for children she had trouble controlling.  I was mad, because I tried not to write referrals for my students.  (To whom or what would I be referring them?)    I had to write the referrals out again and afix my signature to them, which seemed strange, although I complied.  But I wrote out all the referrals on the same slip, a very tiny return address sticker-sized slip, and I realized before even handing it to Ms. Garcia, the assistant principal, that I would have to write each name out again on a separate, larger slip.  So I began to do so, though I didn't know the last names for any of the students who had received referrals. However, I did know some of factors that would influence the student's reported behavior, so I wrote a detailed account of the etiology of each incident.  I was very annoyed.  Then I also  was supposed to help revise the grade reports for each student.  In this school, every six weeks the teachers would have to swap around their "teacher's pets."  This was the school's way of dealing with favoritism.  Thus the top student in the class would not monopolize all the teacher's positive attention--rather, the top three students would do so.  
4007 20030122082408 A Book of Human Language   I was dropped off at the back entrance to a public school along the beach.  It was early morning...spectacular morning, with the sun and fog lifting off the ocean together, particles of gold in the sky.  My mom was singing loudly from inside the technology room; she was preparing for her first class.  My friend Shirin was walking up the boardwalk.  She was commenting that instead of Pakistani food, we should make and eat more Peruvian food.  Her friend, B---,was head of the Congregational Church and, although Pakistani, was always making Peruvian dishes with potatoes, Shirin said.  "So much better than alu gobi," she said.    Inside the building I walked into the faculty room.  People were sitting around waiting for a celebratory dinner to begin. There were items to be prepared for the dinner but no one was doing anything. There was a large head of cbbage/lettuce that I jokingly referred to as "The General," because it looked so imposing.  An older man who looked a lot like one of the PE instructors at my college took great offense at this, and in fact left in a huff.  I began cleaning the cabbage-lettuce, and my Nanny, who was also sitting at the table, began to help me.  "Things go MUCH FAST-AH with two pairs of hands, huh, Ali?" she said in her Nanny-way.  "Yes," I nodded. But faculty from the elementary school where I used to work had already come in with pots of pasta dishes.  My Nanny turned back to the table, leaving me to dry the cab-let leaves and assemble the salad.  I looked at the table: everyone was standing, silent, with heads bowed.  I looked agin, and felt awkward.  I'd missed whatever it was that had been said that made them stand in such strained silence.  I walked over to the table and realized that they had been saying grace.  I felt embarassed that I hadn't realized that this was what they were doing, and that they hadn't invited me over to say it with them.  We were eating dinner--lasagna with some sort of sauce with large sausages floating in it--and groups of students kept coming to the door.  "Turn down the lights," someone at the table said.  "Hide under the table and pretend we're not here."  Then I was walking down a twisted and wooded road, kind of like the roads around my parents' house, but even more forested.  A group of Portuguese children was in front of me--the oldest no more than six.  I was trying to get them to walk safely, in single file.  "Una fila, una file,' I kept saying to them.  We passed by an enormous plant, almost tree-size, with a single long stem and a gigantc elephant ear-like leaf.  The stem bent and dipped to follow us as we passed.  The plant's shadow on the ground looked like an elephant trying to lick the top of one little kid's head.    We came to a house under construction--it was actually the site of my parents' neighbors' barn.  Workers had excavated a large hole to the side of the barn and were installing pipes; water was spewing everywhere. The children I was walking with had aged; they were teenagers and wanted to go their separate ways.  I was talking with one of them who wondered if my parents would pay her, as they said they would, for doing chores.   Rick had written a set of poems under the pseudonym "Prune D. Prune."  They were being displayed on the wall of the under-construction house using an editor like the one Rick uses for programming--except in this display, the different parts of speech and the different poetic tropes were highlighted in different colors.  The last lines were "...study polychromy and electroscopy(?) [sic]/ discover some greater evil of the human spirit, unless it all/ expose some good."  (There was also some section speciffically mentioning cannelini beans and carrots.)  (In my dream Rick's whole poem reminded me of part V of   Eliot's "The Dry Salvages" .)   To communicate with Mars, converse with spirits,  To report the behaviour of the sea monster,  Describe the horoscope, haruspicate or scry...  
4011 20030213074608 Her Psychology Today   At my old political philosophy professor's house, we were having a read-through for a play we were putting on.  It was no play I had ever actually read, or seen, but it was a play by Sartre.  Sort of "Gilligan's Island" meets "No Exit."  We were a bunch of people from the 'fifties hanging out in ottomans and La-Z-Boys, being alternately (or simultaneously, in some cases) annoying, pampered, and existential.  Erin Coughlin from my high school was drving around a car  that was really just the abrubtly truncated cab of a pickup truck.  I was driving, too, along the road just by my parents' house.  The roads were flanked by high piles of snow, turning the already-narrow street into a single-lane road.  I made the mistake of stopping in front of the driveway of our neighbors, the Kramers--I thought I saw someone sitting and smoking in a giant tractore parked at the top of the driveway. Indeed, I did: it was Megan Kramer.  Meanwhile, I was blocking traffic, and an older couple in a station wagon narrowly avoided plowing into me.  I drove off, creating havoc.    I finally got rid of my car somehow and started walking.  I was walking along the side of the road and realized that the sidewalk had given out and the ground was swampy.  Oncoming cars kept swerving onto the side of the road and driving where I was walking.  I gave them glares but they just pointed to the portion of the road where I had already walked.  I looked back and realized it was completely flooded--in such a  way that you couldn't tell the depth of the water.  As I kept on walking, the water on the side of the road grew deeper.  At one point I passed the side entrance to a massive modern bank building.  Three workmen were up to their heads in water.  When I got to the front entrance of the bank I saw that the entire building was flooded.  Water was streaming out of thirty-second story windows.  Workers in constructin helmets were trying to shovel water out, or perhaps dig a large trench to divert the flow of water, just in front of the building.  Two workmen were shaking their heads in dismay in front of the building.  There was a figure in the office foyer behind them, rapping furiously on the glass.  -It's no use, one said to the other.  We can't get him out.  My heart was heavy.  I wanted to cry.  I went up to the foyer; about twenty people were inside, but there was no water where they were, yet.  However, passer-by had also squeezed into the foyer to gawk.  There was no sign of the man who had rapped on the glass: only a bunch of worn out people standing around in a bank lobby, some annoyed because they couldn't cash their checks.    Jikishi-ninshin   I keep waking up from the dreams I have in the middle of the night, waking bolt upright out of bed and needing to walk around for a while to convince myself I am awake and not dreaming.  For the most part the dreams I wake from are not that earth-shattering.  When I woke up at three a.m., I had been dreaming that I was in my bed.  I was seeing myself in the bed and everything was fire-red and smoky.  In fact, I was seeing not myself but the shadow I made on the wall. (Oh, now this seems really silly.)  The thing giving off all the light, heat (for it was warm), and smoke was, bizzarely enough, the liquid slurry with which you make paper.  I was going to make paper and somehow it was going to allow me to see myself, not just my shadow.  The odd thing about this realization was just that: it was a realization that encompassed all my senses.  As I stared at my shadow, the words came into my mind as you might experience giant words, inscribed in stone on the base of a monument, that you read and heard aloud and rubbed your fingers across simultaneously.  I grasped their sense utterly and immediately, as though they were written on a tablet that had been placed before my eyes and read all at once in a single tone.  When I woke bolt upright, the thing that came to mind was the  Flower Sermon . 
4013 20060124083807 metropolis  1) In the towering office / school complex. a cog in the wheel, running here and there, never quite sure where I should be.  My one job to sit at this one desk in the sunlight on some sub-floor (the floors were broken into sub-floor sections connected by portals and free-floating stairways, as in childhood futuristic conceptions of space life).  But one day I convinced Rick and others to join me in exploring the whole building and so we went up to the very top where executives were meeting, and stealthily tried to make our way down again, but I was apprehended kindly by Betty Polk (flautist from orchestra) who asked me to address the board of directors and let them know about Nancy Moser's upcoming birthday.  I stood for a while, hands folded in front of me, waiting for the group settled in overstuffed armchairs in the dark-panelled meeting room to quiet and come to attention.  Afternoon sun was filtering in through the opposite end of the building.  "Well," I said, "Nancy Moser is the assistant to the director and as we all know she is wonderful fun."  My head was racing as I wasn't sure exactly what to say or why I was the one who had to say it.  Betty interrupted, "Nancy and Ali are very similar," she said.  "Yes, we are the same height and have similar taste in clothing," I said. "Except she is fun and I am not," I concluded.  "We are opposites in that respect.  Like particles and anti-particles -- fun and anti-fun."    Racing back down to my desk so that I could finish up whatever tiresome work I had for the day, I realized that I could not remember what floor I worked on.  The building turned into an elongated vertical version of the central section of our high school.  The whole middle section of the building was a hospital, and I passed numerous doctor's offices, clinics and operating facilities.  But I could not recall where my office was.  I stepped outside a large steel fire door in the hopes that outside of it I could regain my sense of direction (even though I knew I had never entered the building or gone to my job from that direction).  The door locks behind me and I realize I cannot regain entrance.  I am running frantically (now the hallway truly is the hallway from my old highschool, but more cavernous and hangar-like) and streams of people are pouring through the hallways in the opposite direction; I am the only one running this way.  There is my childhood friend Amy Weidner, standing in the crowd, bewildered like me.    "Why did they lock the door?" she asks.    "I have no idea," I say, and grab her hand and we run to the next set of doors, which are wide open, opening onto what seems like a train terminal, with stairways of imrpobable height rising everywhere.    "Do you remember where I worked, Amy?" I ask plaintively and Amy pulls out a battered map of the facility with an index where she has labelled where people work and on what floors.    "Didn't you work on L?" she says and indeed, there is something on the paper that indicates that -- it may just be a note that she and I work on the same floor (though not in the same department).  Before me, swimming before my eyes as I go up the escalator with Amy, a list in her handwriting of the reasons she should go on living.  "Trite, I know, it seems," she says, "to say 'Question your father' or 'Keep on living', but I know that I must transcend the silence of my youth, the quietness of my house."  I almost tell Amy about how my mother, in my youth, used Amy's house and family as the exemplars of normality  par excellence  but I do not, instead filing away the knowledge that each of us feels strange to the other, that the outside perceptions are no match to internal reality, that in fact these realities are sometimes unknown even to us. I hold Amy's hand again.   2) Scene with my mom and cousin Kathy, the great wind and the house made of rock (?)  3) Scene of the 1920s fop  4) Scene of the cartoon adventure, the emergence of the child underwater  
4030 20060810090209 I was holding a long stretchy piece of fabric with another woman, somewhat like Laura Campagnola.  She didn't have the end of the fabric in her hand and this was making it difficult to close the gate, which is what the fabric became when stretched over the dirt road entrance to this baronial mansion.  When I saw my sister Kate she was doing something that somehow hurt my feelings so I said to her, "Listen, I know that you don't want to be my friend," at which she burst into tears, as though she were very small. Until this point I had not known that she did want to be friendly to me.  Mark Sloniker was there.  The teacher gave me a small pennywhistle and said that I could just go ahead and harmonize with the soybeans.  THere was a small patch down the dirt road a bit, maybe only fifty feet, and I went htere and played a single note, uncertain of what to do.  As I played I realized that the wind through the soybeans played a note of its own, almost like a harmonic overtone, so I played my note stronger and the harmonic grew stronger.  The goal, I realized, was to play music.  Rick came into the house, upset.  A pheasant had pecked at the books he had laid outside to air out, but forgotten to bring in at night.  "Repetition and pattern," he muttered, implying that things needed to be done the same way, and carefully, to avoid mishaps such as this.  When I checked on the books, outside at my parents' place by the compost heap, I saw that the pheasant really had done little damage besides tearing out all the different colored pieces of construction paper I had been using as bookmarkers.  There was the orange covered sixth grade reader I had from my grandmother.  Sarah was looking at the concrete foundation of the house, trying to figure out if mud would seep in to the old playroom, but I didn't think it would.  The walls were too thick, two feet, and the dirt outside was not at the level of the shelf she was pointed to.  The small deck in the back had been moved so now there was more room.  You could look in a window at the long shelf currently along the southern side, now on the west above where the carve out for a fireplace is.  I was at the old Peachtree development in Mount Sinai, the 25A entrance, but now it was in Nashville.  I turned in because I saw peaches growing from the trees. I stopped my car.  I was trying to decide if I could pick the trees. On the other side of the road there was a tree with huge peached the size of large globelike paper lanterns.  One had fallen to the ground and had been completely eaten out by ants, until only the shell of skin remained.  Someone had put fake flowers that looked real inside of it. I climbed the tree, which was not tall but which had only one main branch that split into smaller branches.  All around day lilies and other flowers were blooming, though it seemed late in the season.  I thought perhaps because this spot was shady the flowers were preserved longer. I wrapped my legs around the trunk of the tree and pulled myself up to the higher branches, my legs dangling.  I tried shaking the tree to loose the fruit but none would fall.  I somehow picked a donut shaped one, but maybe that was down on the ground at another tree across the road.  I hung fromt he branch to get down and my arms were long enough to get me almost to the ground without a real fall.    In a partially built house I was trying to get the real etate agent to tell me whether I could pick the peaches for free, but she kept walking through automatically closing wooden doors and down unfinished stairwells.  I met an older man and asked him as his wife approached. As they answered and talked about the three phases ofthe peach situation in this development, starting with the "Georgia mold" they used to preserve thepeaches with, for spread, I realized they had come into Finer Things at sme point, and told them that.  Just before I woke up, we were making mordnat baths and brighteners in buckets through some cruise ship demonstration. 
4049 20030508113208 Give me a story and give me a bed   In my dream, my Aunt Ginny lived in my Nanny's old place, as I remembered it from childhood, Nassau summer sun streaming in pale and golden, the sounds of children running through sprinklers outside.  I walked through room after room, a visitor.  My Uncle Scott was there, lying down but actually suspended in air.  Underneath him, my cousin Wesley played.  Somewhere in another room I heard my cousins Thomas and Harrison.  I was with my sister Sarah and my mom, suddenly, and we were dropping off our stuff as we would be staying for a while.  The dining room shades were drawn and the room was muffled and dark.  My mom and sis were dropping their stuff in piles all over the room but I thought that was rather rude, so I stuck my pile of papers in a neat stack beneath the over-upholstered striped chair in the corner between the window and the china cabinet.  There was my Aunt Doreen's purse, so I knew she had to be in the house somewhere, although this seemed strange.  My Nanny bustled through the room, calling to my aunt Ginny.  "Ginny," she said, loudly, communicating here without words. She then pointed at a Franklin Mint-style lifelike china figurine.  "There's the Baby Jessica I got you," she finished--I knew that my Nanny had gotten that figurine for my aunt soon after she had married and was trying to have kids. Now it was sitting on my Nanny's old t.v., in the section where she used to keep all the photos of her grandkids. Baby Jessica was dressed in the same pink glittery lacy dress I used to make my transgendered teddy bear HiShi wear, before my aunt made little denim suit pants and a cable knit sweater with suspenders for it, and I made it a he.  There was a party going on outside; children were playing.  But my Aunt Doreen had locked the screen door so that children couldn't run in and out of the house, "letting all the cool out."  I was washing dishes in front of our current sink, except there was a window and a vast, dazzingly sunny shadeless backyard.  I had forgotten!  My friend Laura was having a birthday party outside.  I wanted to go--I was too late to sing Happy Birthday, as I arrived outside just as they were finishing. Mrs. Sobik had been leading the whole group.    But I couldn't stay.  Now I was upstairs, on an impossibly high bunk bed, fifteen feet off the ground. There was a rolling ladder of the sort used for stocking high shelves in super-supermarkets--it was made of lightweight, with bannistered steps that went up at an angle, and a platform at top.  The platform of this ladder was level with my bed, and I needed to get to it so that I could play the song from the Sundays, "Can't Be Sure".  The selection of the song involved climbing onto the platform, which became a long, endless tunel, spiraling downward.  The songs were patches along the tunnel, printed in the order of their appearance on the album.  They were a luminous, spiraling blue.  You had to descend as far as you needed to touch the glowing patch and have the song play.    But the songs kept changing order.  First they were arranged in reverse--last track first, first track last and closest to bottom.  Then, after I had crawled into the tunnel head first, they switched on me.  Suddenly my track was near the top.  I couldn't get myself turned around; I was struggling, this whole time, to keep one foot on the top rung of the tunnel, my last tenuous connection with my bunk bed and something rooted to the ground.  I had the sensation of drowning as I struggled to right myself without releasing my foot.  I finally managed to get up to the top of the platform and bend over, backwards, onto the bed.  The rift between the platform and the bed had widened: somehow I had been able to span four feet in that back bend.  I had an inexplicable fear of the floor.      But when I woke, I was singing "Here's Where the Story Ends".  Somewhere, too, a river was flooded.  The memories of creatures I'd never seen before flushed out by the water; a secret land.  
4064 20060719080808 We had a discussion about art at the Plowhaus.  A patronhad been driven away by some event or interaction.  Our own discussion was taking place at some building owned by Kim and Rusty.  Kate, Sarah and others such as Maddy Tronrud and Tara were sleeping in various rooms of the house.  Earlier there had been another vacation house that we were trying to figure out how we would use as accommodations.    Earlier I was walking through a privet hedge that had a hole cut in it like a gate and an arbor way beyond it.  Small holes had been cut in the hedge to let roses in full bloom through.  I was hoping the Doriet and  Todd would get married here.  The hedges were so high, almost twenty feet, and formed a perfect backdrop.  The chairs for their ceremony were placed closer to the woods, however.  THis time I realized that I would play my viola liek the Pied PIper to lead people to their seats.  When I walked through the hedge I realized, htough I thought I had been in Tennessee or upstate New York, actually I was on my parents' property walking toward the Blamey's house.  Looking back on my parents' house, now that it was night, I could see that there were greatchinks between the boards running vertically that made up the outside walls.  I went closer and could see through one of the chinks, almost put my hand through it.  When I went inside to share my discovery my dad had actually removed one of the boards wholesale to do some sort of repair.   Later it was the kitchen of our own place and Dana Robertson and I were trying to avoid the advances of an unsavory relative by marriage.  I had to get some piece on my viola ready.  I had many violas, all sawed in two.  I was trying to put them in their cases.  Upstairs I was trying to oversee the sorting of packets of seeds from Brazil.  Some had flowers and representative seed pods as well to help identify the plants.  The packages weren't necessarily labelled correctly.  THe packages were big, the size of a large (6 x 8") index card.  I accidentally opened several packages, including a sweet potato one full of purple-green tiny tubers.  There was a pull string for a lamp just above our hea.  It was fraying and Mary Ray, who gave us the seeds, lifts it up saying "Donna Jean won't want to be responsbile for this so we'll just shut it off and get it out of the way."  There's still another light in the room so when she shuts the one off witht he string we can still see.  I see Rick come in and sit down by the frame of the door -- the room runs horizontally, with windows behind the long table we're working on, the ceiling tapering down to a point maybe, one door in, beyond it the stairs.  A policeofficer is lecturing Rick.  I realize Rick has been getting in big fights downstairs while I've been apart from him.  I look at Rick to try to figure out what's happening -- he's visibly shaken, but otherwise calm, and seemingly unhurt except for big circles under his eyes, not black and blue but fatigue.  The police officer is tanned.  He has both ears pierced, and in both ears he has large circle earrings with diamonds, in just his left ear he has three dangle earrings shaped like question marks with diaonds in them.  He is talking  about all the distractions and difficulties going on downstairs, including Kima nd Rusty's dogs, who bark all the time and tear aroudnthe house.  The police officer's talk switches to a movie.  "We only do this once a month so no you cannot go on a one-day vacation," we hear the officer say to Rick, who is off-screen in the short film.  He is sliding under the rings of a wrestling mat but kind of like a plastic bendable doll.  Fragments of a scene -- a lady walking.  I ask jokingly "Is that Paris SImpson?" but I realize that it's Sarah's friend Jana.  Franne Lee is walking around handing out papers or doing some sort of promotion.  In real life I squat next to  Rick to ask if he got in a fight with Bob and he says yes.  I ask if it was a verbal altercation or physical and he says laughingly that it was very physical. 
4073 20060629093211 There was Sartre (he was just about 5'6" or so, with dark hair and strange piercing roving eyes).  A bunch of us were in the woodshed that needed cleaning out.  We were hauling stuff around and I desperately wanted to ask Sartre about Simone de Beauvoir -- what she was like as a person, what Sartre's true opinions of her and her thinking were, I really just wanted honest first-hand talk, not necessarily directed to any end -- but Sartre was there with another woman and I felt uncomfortable discussing de Beauvoir.  The woodshed looked beautiful, a change from the dingy and cluttered space we had entered into.  Now it was still dim, but the single bare bulb on the ceiling shone warmly on a clean-swept floor and white spackle buckets stacked neatly to one side. Everything stored in there, previously jumbled together without any organization, was now easily accessible.  We had thrown very little away becasue it all seemed mostly potentially valuable.  We had just organized it.  Someone had destroyed a vegetable garden I had made in a plot of land outside the house and Sartre recognized this.  Going through the strange amusement park-like outdoor area, seeing the netting enclosed spaces I at first thought were temporary hotels -- actually batting cages or bouncy ball pits, depending on the need.  I am with a young child, a group actually, who are acting destructively. I've got to gethtem outside so we can catch a ferry back to some mainland, and also so we can talk about respectful actions.  THe one kid I am physically nearest too ends up with some kid's baseball helmet in his hands.  He is like a stretched-out version of Javier Rios, but with more of an inner city kid swagger somehow.  We are almost by the exit so I make him go with me to the person taking up tickets.  He shoves the hat towards her, umbles something that gets her mad.  I step in to explain how he found the hat int he bouncy ball pit, how we would appreciate if she could turn it in to the lost and found, or let us know where it is.  "It's supposed to be out front by the telephones, but it hasn't been open since 2000," she says, taking the helmet.  We thank her.  On the way out I am asking the boy if he could tak about the difference between the way he interacted with the girl (her nametag said "Rhonda" or "Irrhonda") and the way I did but perhaps he is not understanding me because he doesn't even remember what girl I'm talking about.  On the other side we're walking past a huge port with big ships but because it is a long time after our bota was supposed to sail we think we've missed it.  Eventually I spot my dad -- he may have waited for us. On the boat sailing we see Laura Sobik, another woman with her spine visibile through her shirt, other men and women in a gym -- I start repainting an oil painting, just adding some bits.  THere is a sold piece of my mo's with the title -- "To My Friend, Who Loves These Spaces Too and Is Aware They May All Soon Be Gone".  I see only the back of the canvas with its rough sketch of a harbor scene.  The people int he gym and the oil painting of an aboriginal woman in straw hat surrouinded by green and yellow flowers -- all are part of a television series called "Makeovers without Surgery" -- except the word for makeover starts with a "p" somehow.  There is a small funny baby and her older sister. I am trying to make funny farting noises on the baby but someone's hands are over my mouth.  Some gathering (wedding?) at my Nanny's old place.  Looking through my Nanny's old house, everything stripped from the walls in anticipation of it going on market.  The back room where the washer and dryer used to be in larger and has a lead in that is walled but has no roof.  There are a strange set of stpes going down tot he basement that suddenly are cut-off.  There is no back wall.  We are thinking of buying the house but I am trying to figure out if all our art will fit in it.  We would have to make renovations to make this room useable but I am inriuged by the set of blocked stairs I never saw.  
4080 20060626105608 nightmare dream i kept returning to: we are in a resort style property with a lodge on it.  a beuatiful lady and her beautiful male consorts are getting in and out of the hot tub / pool area.  e michael harrington explaining that the human race will continue to need a constant source of water to imerse themselves into, "well into the year 5000 -- indeed, it will be the only way we will continue to evolve past what we are now ... even if it's just as simple as taking a bath once a day."  the weird stuff doesn't start until we get out of the water and start walking around.  a carpet of pine needles across various parts of the property so that though we are surrounded by green and life our steps are silent and the ground reddish-brown and the surface seemingly dead.  in a small white set-up tent, a yellow extension cord is hanging, almost hanging one of the beautiful lady's men.  there are two other guys with him (and me) and they are both vehemently denying any involvement.  my intuition gives me a creepy feeling from everyone and i realize evil is workign through these men to do things it wants to manifest.  of its own accord the yellow extension cord first forms a noose, then disentangles around the man, not without first propping him up like a crucified jesus int he stocks.  i am horrified and want to run far away fromthe property but i can't get away just yet, not without arousing lots of suspicion and being forcibly held on property.  inside the house things are equally if not more bizarre.  a full-grown man with long dirty blond hair is rising around on a giant, adult-sized model of the big wheels from _the shining_.  nobody can see him all the time except me, and he keeps emerging from around corners grinning maniacally and bumping into people, then riding away.  when they go to tell somebody about it, no one believes them because they can't see him at that instant (even though many of them have seen him themselves earlier).  i am about to try to escape but forces are trapping me here; i keep trying to wake up to real life but falling back to this space.  that spot along the river; it is now on the flipside of the horizon i normally glimpse in my dreams.  the idea is that we will walk down to the bank, let ourselves into the current and float downstream.  but the current is so swift it has worn a channel into the bed of the river, a deep-flowing culvert.  i am afraid if we step in here we will be drowned (it is a group of us).  i am thinking of using thick vines to lower myself in but realize they are attached to a dead tree that will fall as well.  i cross over to the other side of the river to try there.  never-ending sort of house, also was similar to the cottage we stayed in at Rugby recently, so much so that I woke up a few times saying "I'm dreaming of this place because it is haunted".  at the top of the stairs there are two doors almost on top of each other, so that when you open one you are immediately confronted by another, which you must open to get itno the hallway.  the old wallpaper and furnishings -- old dools without hair or clothes, washbasins, worn coverlets -- are all still here.  in one room, gathering my belongings, i peek beyond to the strange stairs which i ventured up once -- i did not go further, into the old beams exposed attic.  i see a light int he room next to mine, whcih i hadn't even known existed, and think it is a ghost but it is just one of the party who has been staying here and is now getting her things.  i am talking with senator bill frist about his support for an amendment restricting marriage to permit it only between a man and a woman.  i am trying to understand his position and whether it truly reflects the belief of his constituents.  he seems confident that it does but his own personal convictions play a large role too, i can tell, and i am trying on some level to convince him otherwise.  uncle mike, strange child in a large van dedicated to branca family travel.  uncle mike has a goldfish in a plstic bag we are wondering how to keep alive. 
4093 20030422104408 dream of 4/20 Someone said my drawings were full of life.  I dreamt that I dreamt, for three nights in a row, of someone getting murdered in a bathroom.  Then I woke from my dream-within-a-dream and it was happening to me.  There was a dingy underground lair.  Thieves were coming back to murder someone, creeping through underbrush and past exposed pipes and culverts.  The hour was late afternoon; our spot beneath the ground was so low the sun looked like it had sunk already and an artificial dusk crept in around us.  I hid under dry mouldy grass clippings.  A dog was trying to sniff me out.  I burrowed deeper.  We were in an orchestra practice.  It was a temporary practice for an all-county orchestra. The teacher, a young woman, was speaking to us in French.  We understood her. I realized the point she was trying to make to us--by talking in a foreign language she was trying to communicate that we, playing a classical piece, were similarly playing in a foregin tongue.  We would need to use all the techniques of expression, all the vernaular of emotion, in order to speak with our audience.    I was trying to decide which hula hoop to buy.  dream of 4/21  In the backyard of my parents' home, a trail I had never seen, an endless wood.  Then there were stones, a gulch like a river bed with stones the size of trucks.  Wesley was walking with me, and all my southern cousins.  It was the path between lives, I realized.  I woke up beacuse I did not want to walk on it.  As I woke up, my grandmother and my great aunt stood before me like paper cutouts.    After I returned to sleep: another couple was being followed, up the concrete stairwell/fire escape route of their apartment.  It was a large apartment, a never-ending house.  An unwelcome guest had arrived: an old boyfriend, come to kill me.  Outside--for although the house inside was endless, it was endless like a maze, repetitive, and once you got outside it could end--in the courtyard, fair-skinned Filipino children were dancing.  I was trying to warn their teacher not to leave the door open, as my murderer still had not gotten inside the house, and I was hoping to make him think it was impermeable.  He and another friend of his were at the door.  dream of 4/22  I was looking for clothes and a place to go to the bathroom.  My cousin Liz was wearing clothes that I liked but that would be too big for me; I had ransacked my sister Katie's drawer.  My cousin David had a bad drawing of me--I was all neck and a skinny head--as well as a calligraphy practice sheet listing the names of all the schools he had graduated from, most notably his elementary.  I peeked into one bathroom that looked empty but felt occupied.  I saw only a towel hanging on the shower rod, swaying in the wind.  I looked again, calling, "Hello?  Anyone here?"  I saw a slight movement in a tub opposite the shower; there was Teresa Servellon, my old principal, in a bathing suit, sitting in the tub.  Hornets were dropping out of a table, encased in jelly.  Eggs were falling out, too.  Everywhere were long caravans of ants.  A man was complaining with Rick and Brandon.  They were very upset over something that I probably could have found annoying if I put alot of energy into it.  "Full of hubris," the curly-headed man said, referring to himself, but what he actually meant was that he was full of righteous anger. The man turned into a woman and parted ways.  "We should hang out with her more," said Brandon.  "She's a genius and a Miata," said Rick.  In the meantime I was cutting blocks of ice into pendant shapes in order to fit them into a metal case some young woman was going to wear around her neck.  The blocks of ice beacme multi-colored fudgsicles, the shades of the desert.  Up on a hill, a man was preaching.  He was from Georgia, and when someone tried to walk the woman home, he launched into a sermon on social codes of the South.  A woman who looked twenty was actually going to turn sixty the next day.  The preacher man announced it and the sixty year old woman, an artist, seemed embarrassed. 
4094 20070309101008 in my mom and dad's house i walked into the kitchen only to find everyone upset, getting ready for christmas and a new year's party.  we heard the garbage trucks in the street and mom wanted to run out to give them a christmas bonus.  dad was not supportive of the idea, and kate went after him her eyes wet with tears: "i love my mom and want to see her happy."  i said i would try to run after them, so i took small bills from the mom's hands and ran down the driveway in nothing but my stocking feet and some strange thin skirt and top.  the driveway was all ashes, cinders and ice. it was just dark with the last of the sunset dull orange behind the backs of the trees, just at the base of the horizon like the edge of the world was on fire.   it wasn't the garbage men we had been hearing, or if we had they had already left.  but a white  coupe de ville was doing wheelies in the road in front of zoe's old house and making a noise like a garbage truck.  i ran to pick up the mail.  the mailbox looked full but it was really three compressed liquor boxes and two yellow folders that had been in kate's car and that she had tossed into the mailbox when she was in a rush to tidy up her ride.  i carried them back with me up the driveway.  the ice was freezing up fast.  my dad had made a low strip of quik-set concrete all down the middle of the driveway to help it retain some sort of shape.  inside everyone was more upset than when i left.  it was already eight p.m. and guests were arriving for our party. sean and jeannie arrived with multiple relatives of jeannie's.  beth gilmore's daughters arrived and gracie asked if i wanted to go with her to neptune's garden, her favorite seafood restaurant, featuring food of the athena coast, which is somehow where we lived.  i went upstairs to try to change.  this was a house we had just clenaed out to move out of, or maybe one we had just cleaned out to move into.  when i went up the narrow wooden ladder to the upstairs i had to pull myself up .  it was my grandmother's house and the hatch entrance was inside the old sewing room.  just once more, i thought, i would go into the old closet across the hall.  i opened the door and realized it was the portal to a never-ending house, that it was like the dream house of harry and amy's where an entire other house runs parallel to the rest of the known house.  i was going to appear downstairs and surprise everyone but i realized i had never even been in this part of hte house before.  the small door at the back of the small closet opened up into a narrow entrance way and then a large room that curved around a central shaft and opened into several separate rooms.   there was a mantle along the far wall, the outside of the house.  and the was a room on the far inside room that had chairs like a small schoolhouse.  there was a dumbwaiter lit by museum style light with glassplating over it.  the embossed metal lettering read "crafted t. jefferson, monticello, 1787."  i slid back the glass paneling and touched the dumbwaiter, whcih swayed back and forth slightly.  i walked a little further and saw, hung in the central shaft of the house, gleaming brass and ancient, a large bell which hung in darkness, motionless.  no air moved around it and it was encased in glass. no one had seen the bell in many years but it remained in the perfect center of the house, its point of equilibrium.  there was a slight crack in it. the shaft it hung in was so perfectly black that it made me dizzy to be near it.  there was no way of knowing how deep it was, or knowing how the bell was hung -- there was a solid chain that seemed to go up in space without ever making contact above.  i walked away dizzy.  this was the representation of the divine in the center of the house.  across the way there was a perpetual fire.  in front of it there was a small cauldron and then a small millstone on its side with fire coming out of its center.  this was the source of the perpetual fire, and though it fell on the floor it would never catch.  it could only burn inside stone.</p
4162 20030731094407 I was almost late to the airport, but I arrived in time to stand behind two tall men going on the same flight as me.  I was helping them put their bags on a rack, where they would eventually be searched.  A squat woman approached, and I told her all about the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.  Actually at first Kate was sitting down next to the men claiming that the Valley was "a center of power", and that interplanetary forces were aligned there.  I turned around, hearing this, and said that there were actually big magnets in the earth down there that once yearly, at around Thanksgiving time, sucked all the RVs and senior citizens out of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin and deposited them in spots like La Feria and Weslaco.  People thought I was serious.    I was telling the woman about the five North American migratory fly zones that converged over the Rio Grande Valley, and how she should go down sometime in eraly winter or early spring and see all the birds.  A man came into my Nanny's upstairs bathroom, where Sarah and I were getting dressed.  It was Sarah's date.  He was also dropping off a stack of scripts for us to start reading over so we could begin practicing a play together.  I felt uncomfortable since I was in my bath towel.  Kate, Sarah, and I were with Ray Turner in the dining area of a McDonalds/Wal-Mart/Quikie art complex.  A woman by the cash register wasbreakdancing and doing complicated gymnastics.  We were sitting down with our mouths wide open.  At the end of her performance she asked people for change.    "Don't make me beg," she said.  "You saw me out there.  I don't need to beg."  But my sisters did not have small bills to give her.  We were driving to Texas the next day, and I needed to keep my cash.  My sisters went inside the convenience mart to get change: I saw the woman hanging out out the edge of the shops, where a cash register area delimited the boundaries of the store.  But my sisters dawdled int he shop, their change in hand, and the woman went away without them giving her anything.  We looked down the corridors of the mall (for that is where we were) for her, but we could not find her.  Later, on the subway with Marcela and Ray, I looked down to see my cell phone ringing.  It was the woman.  I had to explain to her that my sisters had gotten change to give to her, but had not known that she was still there.    I was driving along in some area of Long Island I had never really driven through before-- although in another dream I had seen this same stretch.  There had initially been a purpose for me to drive out this far, but now I was just lost.  I turned down one steep hill and found that my car, an automatic, was in a strange gear that had been added at the base ofthe gear shift.  I tried to pull it back into drive as I sped down the hill.  I could see a vast crowded interstate to my right, far down another set of hills.  Directly in front of me were woods and beyond, the sea.  It was already 8:30 p.m. but the sun was high and glistening in the sky as though it were 3 p.m. in the afternoon.  I turned off to the left onto what I thought would be a promising shortcut.  But as I drove I relaized I was driving through crystal clear water.  The road bed itself turned to dirt and shell covered with straw, and eventually just to sand.  I sent my car back by itself and crawled along on my hands and knees.  At the end of the sunken road, I could see a house I'd admired many times from the opposite side of the harbor.  Below theroad stretched out clear blue sparkling sea, and beyond the house, inexplicably, a hill covered in the sea, as though we sat in an air bubble at the bottom of a fishbowl.  There were trees in front of the hill of sea.  On my way back out the driveway I met a man who was lost too.  "Can you tell me how to get back to the main road?"  I asked him.  He couldn't; he'd been driving around for hours, too.   He pulled out a compass. "Perhaps this will help," he said.  "we need to follow these blue marks on the road," he said.  I looked down to where he was pointing.  There were two baby blue marks like angel wings on the asphalt.  
4183 20030219131008 Not as a god, but as a god might be    The avatar of the god, dressed all in white and carrying a bundle, came into the suite of rooms.  I was the manservant who answered the door and let him in.  I knew he was the avatar; he let me know with a look but let me know, too, to be silent.  The owner of the house stood by my side, but I watched the whole dream unfold before my eyes from the vantage point of another.    "May I see the bridegroom?  May I see the bride?" the avatar asked. The owner of the house thought that this man at his door was seeking the hand of his wife, or the other women in the house. The owner was angry; what visitor could have such impunity?  The owner of the house would punish him.  He lured the avatar into another chamber in the house, took out a gun, and mortally wounded him.  Meanwhile, the servant knew better, and stood by the doorway, sad.  What evil would happen now that the owner had shot the god that had come to his house?  But the avatar emerged from the chamber, smiling broadly with his garments white as ever and his bundle gone.    "I am so sorry," he said.  "I did not have time to transform into the baby girl; she got so frightened by all the noise that she has hid herself in the closet.  You must try to find her; I must return to the concert of the other gods."    The servant realized that the baby girl must have been the avatar's new form--that was the bundle he had carried into the house.  The servant could hear the baby-girl breathing in another darkened room.  He walked to all the closets and first at one, then at another he heard her breathing and her slight cries.  When he rustled though the linens or the shelves, though, the breathing grew fainter, or shifted.  There were two speakers that amplified the baby girl-god's breathing and her slight cries, so that it was almost impossible to find her.  But she is there, in the dark room, so the servant keeps on looking.   Earlier in the dream I was in high school calculus class.  I hadn't done my homework, so I began to try to do it before class--but there was a ridiculous amount of it, some on special packets that the teacher had given us, and I had forgotten how to do many of the problems. I was frustrated with myself for not keeping up with my work, and especially for forgetting calculus.  In another section of the dream, there was a homeless man and and another man with unkempt hair and a bulky fur-lined suede jacket in a concrete-lined alleyway.  The man with the suede jacket, I learned, was an editor from Vandy.  "He's had a rough night and he might try to mirror whatever you do," said the editor about the homeless man.  "C'mon, I'll walk you past him so he doesn't bother you."  The editor walked me to the road, but the homeless man followed us.  So I walked alongside the homeless man to try to help him get where he was going--he needed to get to a certain portion of Vanderbilt's medical campus.  We found the turn the homeless man needed to make and he went on his way.  There was a woman with long unkempt hair and a slender but curvy figure.  She couldn't speak, or the words that came out of her mouth sounded disjointed and incoherent.  I walked next to her because she seemed confused.  The portion of the campus where we stood was an enclosed walkway with glass windows on oneside and a brick wall on the other. At one point fairly early on it joined up with another glass-encosed walkway, and on the far end it disappeared into a medical building.    Along the brick wall were handcrafted items and artwork from all sorts of artists.  They were hung on the wall almost haphazardly--it was clearly an exhibit, yet there were so many pieces, and they were stuck on the wall so close together, that it looke like the walls of a stand of a street market or bazaar.  The wordless woman was touching all the pieces; she wanted, in particular, a small carved wooden chair that looked like it was of the Inuit.  She took it down from the wall; I had to take it from her and hang it back up.  "You can't touch these things; these things are all for sale," I told her.  She seemed sad and uncomprehending.  We walked together. 
4195 20060712084816 I was hanging out with Danielle and she was talking about work within the prison system.  There was an ongoing modern adaptation of  Little Women .  Amy and Beth were squabbling.  In the adaptation there were two characters with aspects of Amy's personality.  The three young ladiess and Mrs. March were sitting around, all in contemporary clothes, waiting for the fourth daughter to come to celebrate her birthday.  She didn't show, and didn't show.  Finally the Amy / Beth character got up.  "I guess I'll call," she said.  Mrs. March got up and said the same, and the two other young women followed.    We were part of this adaptation and interacting with all the characters. Danielle, Steve, others were in town.  We were goign to go out to eat. I realized I should invite Elena and Keir, who were staying inthe big ramshackle mansion too.  I passed by a shower.  I htought maybe "Melissa", one of the Little Women characters, was in there.  I knocked. "Melissa?" I called.  Keir's voice responded, "She's not in here."  He came out in his towel and tried to give me a hug.  "You're pretty," he said.  "Thanks," I said, "I'm pretty crafty, too," and I tickeld him to get away.  I went down to Elena's room and she was asking about the shower.  The floor of her room was several feet below the main floor. You had to climb down rickety, handrail-less steps to get there.  Keir came back and looking at his arms, I exclaimed, "So he does have multiple arms after all!"  Just at the elbow, but also simultaneously at his torso, his arm branched out into another arm.  He had four arms in all.  We were outside my parents' house and the lost Little Woman had been found.  There were sounds of construction at the Blamey's house.  At first I thought the beeping noise was soemthing else, but it turned out to be the noise of a backhoe.  Some of the guys and I went over to explore.  We walked beneath the dead euonymous.  Keir said soemthing about when he built his own house, having them do it without noise.  As we walked I dropped my mug filled with tea.    My mug, not my mug actually but the mug I use at work, rolled out of my hands and kept rolling.  It rolled across my old neighbor Chuck's lawn. I'd try to chase it but it would always be just ahead of me.  It kept rolling down steep hills and drops and I kept expecteing it to break but it did not.  Finally I had given it up but I turned to see that Keir had caught it and had even poured some of his coffee intoit as thought to intimate that nothing had even spilled fromit.  I thanked him and took a sip.  Later int he supermarket.  Outside the supermarket a blind man I thought was Masa was wearing earphones walking an enormous brown dog.  But as I looked I saw he was blind and gathering carts. I walked through a gateway / archway.  There was a bank getting ready to do a promotion. A man in the Santa suit was getting ready behind his big kettle.  "Santa just taking his time," one of the bank workers said.  When I came back through, there were tables with boxes and bags of candy, part of the promotion.  I was goign to take some for work but did not.  Rick and I were in our bedroom and had just gotten up.  Kate came in but was embarassed to see Rick naked.  She ducked down so she didn't have to seeit.  "If you don't want to dunk, don't look at the junk," I said to her.  Kate needed help with analysis of a story of black youth in the juvenile justice system int he forties.  She had made elborate sketches of what successful entity each young person could become.  Rick was telling me that we would have to go out of townt hat evening to go to some sort of gift shower in Kentucky.  Then the next day we had to be witnesses for some event involving Sean's friend Allen.  I was so mad and was practically crying talking aobut how each of my weeknights was blocked in now, how I'd barely be able to see Danielle, still in town, or get any work done.  I was reading cousin Sam's journal, which mentioned her attempts to understand Sarah, made passing reference to the difficulty faced by Adam Welch and Ross from the wiki, but tht their gifts were sufficient to meet this difficulty attaining recognition. 
4198 2003031413607 The Greatest Generation, Part II   We are having dinner at my paternal grandmother's.  My Aunt Chris and I and some others are setting the table, haphazardly.  There aren't enough clear crystal plates for everyone--in fact, we are only setting the  table for four.  I am about to get some of Rick's and my plates, but my  aunt stops me.  I find some more crystal salad plates, and one large dinner plate, and the table is set.  All four place settings are bunched up in the center of the table in the quadrants of a square no more than 18" x 18".  We are all sitting down to eat--my grandma, my aunt, my mom and dad, who have materialized from somewhere, my cousin Billy, and--although it doesn't seem strange at the time--my dead grandfather.  I'm looking at the bowl of dressed salad, which has about a teaspoon left in it, and at the  bowl of baked beans with pineapple chunks, from which someone is spooning out half of the tablespoon remaining.  My grandfather is saying, annoyed, "This isn't enough for all these people, Anne.  What were you thinking?"  He's put just a teaspoon of each item at the table on his plate.   My grandma is visibly distressed.  She starts saying, "Well, I..." but my grandfather cuts her off again.  I put my arm around her; she is thin and frail.  We are down at the other end of the table now; the whole  house seems like it is lit by gaslight.  Grandma is showing me photographs--she's been playing around on the computer, in PhotoShop, and having a lot of fun.  In my mind suddenly is an image of a secret room inside this house--a room I've seen in other dreams.    In my dream I know I've dreamed this place before; I also know that tonight, if I check, the room will actually be there.  There's a narrow  stairway to it just off the bedroom at the end of the house, just above the garage.  It has high timber-peaked roofs, and there are the  treasures of a generation and two generations ago in it.  It's lit by  warm lighting; in my vision of it, I see a rack of old-fashioned shoes just inside the entrance.  If I went there with my grandma, she'd tell me about the things inside of it, if I asked her.  [big chunk missing here; I forgot it]  We are in a large space that, now that I think of it, geographically resembled my high school library's reading area.  There are large floor- to-ceiling windows at the far end of the space, and big banquet tables are set up for some sort of of awards ceremony.  People are already sitting at them.  I am trying to pretend I am cool, and that I actually could sit anywhere I wanted and be comfortable, rather than winding up sitting next to the same two people I always sit next to.  I have to go  to the bathroom anyway.  In the restroom, which is oddly Japanese--catty-cornered off the banquet  hall, cedar panelled and soft-lit--Arbutus, Rick's maternal grandmother,  is coming out of the stall. Something is wrong with her outfit--I look  again; it's that the end of her pleated flowered skirt is tucked into  the waistband of her pantyhose so she looks naked from the waist down.   I point it out to her and she untucks it.  I am going to the bathroom.  On the wall of my bathroom stall is a grafitti "poster"--"To breathe in wisdom along with the boring", it  says, or something like that, but it says it in both French and English.   That is, as I read it, I know that the language I read is simultaneously  both of those languages.  It's on a long strip of poster board--about  24" x 8"--actually mounted to the wall.  It's signed Kristina/Victoria  something, but the last name is a made-up last name, a street name or  something.    I am still in the bathroom stall--there is no door on it, for some  reason--a tall  gentleman caller  in brown tailored suit and Stetson  hat comes in.  His lapel is decorated with medals.  He smiles and  pretends he doesn't understand when I tell him politely that this is a ladies' restroom; he's poking around the stalls looking for someone.There is an old white-blond haired woman, beautiful and tiny, in a forties-style tailored suit directing people in and out of the bathroom.   I realize this restroom is a crossroads for the  French Resistance .  
4200 20060626110608 nightmare dream i kept returning to: we are in a resort style property with a lodge on it.  a beuatiful lady and her beautiful male consorts are getting in and out of the hot tub / pool area.  e michael harrington explaining that the human race will continue to need a constant source of water to imerse themselves into, "well into the year 5000 -- indeed, it will be the only way we will continue to evolve past what we are now ... even if it's just as simple as taking a bath once a day."  the weird stuff doesn't start until we get out of the water and start walking around.  a carpet of pine needles across various parts of the property so that though we are surrounded by green and life our steps are silent and the ground reddish-brown and the surface seemingly dead.  in a small white set-up tent, a yellow extension cord is hanging, almost hanging one of the beautiful lady's men.  there are two other guys with him (and me) and they are both vehemently denying any involvement.  my intuition gives me a creepy feeling from everyone and i realize evil is workign through these men to do things it wants to manifest.  of its own accord the yellow extension cord first forms a noose, then disentangles around the man, not without first propping him up like a crucified jesus int he stocks.  i am horrified and want to run far away fromthe property but i can't get away just yet, not without arousing lots of suspicion and being forcibly held on property.  inside the house things are equally if not more bizarre.  a full-grown man with long dirty blond hair is rising around on a giant, adult-sized model of the big wheels from _the shining_.  nobody can see him all the time except me, and he keeps emerging from around corners grinning maniacally and bumping into people, then riding away.  when they go to tell somebody about it, no one believes them because they can't see him at that instant (even though many of them have seen him themselves earlier).  i am about to try to escape but forces are trapping me here; i keep trying to wake up to real life but falling back to this space.  that spot along the river; it is now on the flipside of the horizon i normally glimpse in my dreams.  the idea is that we will walk down to the bank, let ourselves into the current and float downstream.  but the current is so swift it has worn a channel into the bed of the river, a deep-flowing culvert.  i am afraid if we step in here we will be drowned (it is a group of us).  i am thinking of using thick vines to lower myself in but realize they are attached to a dead tree that will fall as well.  i cross over to the other side of the river to try there.  with my granny -- she is pulling massive amounts of cash out of various hiding spaces among the stacked-up newspapers.  never-ending sort of house, also was similar to the cottage we stayed in at Rugby recently, so much so that I woke up a few times saying "I'm dreaming of this place because it is haunted".  at the top of the stairs there are two doors almost on top of each other, so that when you open one you are immediately confronted by another, which you must open to get itno the hallway.  the old wallpaper and furnishings -- old dolls without hair or clothes, washbasins, worn coverlets -- are all still here.  in one room, gathering my belongings, i peek beyond to the strange stairs which i ventured up once -- i did not go further, into the old beams exposed attic.  i see a light int he room next to mine, whcih i hadn't even known existed, and think it is a ghost but it is just one of the party who has been staying here and is now getting her things.  i am talking with senator bill frist about his support for an amendment restricting marriage to permit it only between a man and a woman.  i am trying to understand his position and whether it truly reflects the belief of his constituents.  he seems confident that it does but his own personal convictions play a large role too, i can tell, and i am trying on some level to convince him otherwise.  uncle mike, strange child in a large van dedicated to branca family travel.  uncle mike has a goldfish in a plstic bag we are wondering how to keep alive.

4218 20030209144207 A Bad Strategy   I was hangin' with the daughters of privilege in a large suite of a  hotel in Lousiville.  We had been at a big outdoor party; now, women  were coming in and out of the suite, getting ready either to depart or  to retire for the evening.  Several women were really worried about the possibility of a terrorist  attack in Louisville.  In a corner of the suite, in a foyer behind a giant light-up vanity mirror of the sort found in theater dressing  rooms, a teary-eyed woman about my age was relating her story of her  discussion with her Central American gardener.    Her gardener had escaped oppressive regimes, bandits, and violent drug  lords to make it to the United States.  "I asked him what I should do if  terrorists were to attack Louisville, you know, with poison gas or  something," she said, her voice almost breaking.  "I asked him if I  should try to run, what I should do.  "And do you know what he said, that dear man?  He said, 'Que sera, sera,  miss.  You just hide here deep in your big fancy house when the  terrorists come.  You will be safe."    Paranirvana   Rick and I were getting the hell out of Dodge.  We were busting out of  the hotel suite.  We walked through a massive enclosed cobblestone  courtyard at the center of the hotel.  It had large stone and bronze  sculptures, mainly of pigeons, resting at various places like a  sculpture garden.  There were also two escalators placed just a little  off from the center of the atrium, and a ceiling made entirely of frosted glass.  The whole effect was that of really upscale shopping mall.  Outside the hotel, rain was pouring down so hard it was almost impossible to see.  I thought of the umbrellas we had in our downstairs  closet in Nashville.  As we were in Louisville, that thought did us  little good. Rick was really excited about his new super bouncy ball-- the kind that you get from a supermarket vending machine for twenty-five  cents.  He wanted to take it out and show it to me, but in the rain we  really couldn't see anything.   We were walking up a slight hill.  Traffic was divided by a median; we were walking on the right side, not quite on the sidewalk.  For some reason--we thought because the rain was so powerful that it obscured  their vision--cars kept crossing into the lanes on the wrong side of the  median and nearly colliding with each other.  I looked up to the skyline, where the tall buildings were still covered  in thick rain clouds.  A giant rainbow stretched from one side of the  city to the other, and from the ground almost to the zenith.  As I  looked, another, more faint, appeared beneath it.  And as I turned to  show Rick, two more appeared beneath that one.  We looked at the rainbows but kept walking to a large parking lot, just  across the road. Night had fallen suddenly.  A man was standing in the  parking lot and as we approached he asked us for money.  We kept on  walking but I turned back to him, holding up Rick's bouncy ball and  saying, "Sorry, man, we don't have any either."  The man shrugged and walked away, but Rick said, "Keep your eye on him."   I had a large backpack on and for some reason I ducked under a low- hanging metal sign and got stuck.  Rick had to help me out; the man was  eyeing us this whole time.  All the buildings in the lot were seemingly  deserted. The man moved to a truck--his truck, marked with a city seal  decal on the driver's side door--and opened up the door.  Rick and I saw that the building we were walking to--a community fitness  center--was indeed, open. Rick was happy because he could play handball  with the new bouncy ball.  But I was now fearful of the man we'd seen  outside, and when we got inside, I grabbed Rick's hand and we hid behind  a pillar that concealed an elevator.  Much, much later, I was helping someone make a large sculpture for an  exhibit.  We were using bright shiny red plastic--it was hard and yet moldable, and looked like wax lips might look if you dipped them in  shellac. We were making a gigantic ear out of the red plastic.  It was  going to lay down on the floor of the gallery so people could sit near  it and tell it their troubles.  It was the ear of compassion.    
4239 20030402102207 I was in high school in Mr. Fiorelli's class.  We were talking about the Middle East, and on our desks were passed-back papers from about a week's worth of discussion and lecture.  I hadn't been to class in at least that long, and I suddenly realized that I had a bunch of zeros in this unit.  Mr. Fiorelli was talking about the range of troops in the Republican Guard.  No one else in class understood why he was giving us a range and not an exact number, but to me it made sense, although now I'm not sure why.    The lights dimmed and I fell asleep momentarily.  When I woke up all the class had gone in another adjacent room to watch a video.  I got up and headed the other way.  Earlier or perhaps far later in the dream, Rick and I were trying to get to work--we were working in two completely opposite ends of a long valley, with a single ribbon of highway running through it from west to east.  We were going one way originally--we beat out a train to cross a set of railroad tracks, but then we saw a bad accident and turned around in the road to head the opposite way.  But Rick, who was driving, kept swerving onto the median, which was littered with construction rubble and debris.  I finally arrived at my Aunt Kathy's house.  Around the same time, somehow, I glimpsed Adam Halberg, my friend Alina's boyfriend.  He brought me a message from Alina.  It was around the winter holidays and we were talking about going to our respective homes.  Alina and I were going to try to meet up together in the airport, but I didn't know if that would happen since I was running late. "Meltenitz," Adam said to me.    "What did you say?" I asked him.   "Meltenitz. V novim godom.  Happy New Year, pa ulitza."  "Oh," I said.  "Ochen priyatna.  Dobreh dyehn."  Perhaps I was in my Aunt Kathy's house again.  In any case, I sat out on the street and saw a gang of boys on the third floor balcony of a white tower across the street, throwing bleach bottles and aluminum cans onto the cobblestone street and onto passers-by.  I turned to my left and saw, in another cobblestone alleyway (this one roofed off and lit from within) a gang of boys defacing the walls.  A young woman, just about my age and all in black velvet, ran out of a doorway close by the alley and tried to disperse the boys.  I burning with anger as I realized that the boys had grabbed her and were trying to beat her up.  I ran out after them, but they dispersed and took the woman with them.  I realized the town was being overrun by these bullies and I had to do something about it.  I asked the leader, "Bill Vickers", to join me a the top of another tower for a meeting. Really, though, I was going to ambush him.    But when he arrived at the tower I realized to use force to settle this dispute would not work.  We needed to bring Bill Vickers and his crew to justice, and I wouldn't be able to do that if I beat him up.  A police officer in strange olive drab garb, wiht all sorts of military insignias, arrived, mounting the curling steps to the top of the tower.      "Thanks for coming," I said, stepping close to his face to whisper more softly, "I need you to see and document very carefully what is going to happen."  Bill Vicker's cronies--a bunch of old men who were really running the show, training children to be killers through special summer camps, coaching young men like Vickers to be figureheads and giving them special martial training--had arrived up a central set of stairs with reinforcements. The reinforcements were lots of little kids.  I looked back at the policeman as though to say, "You see?  Is this fair, to ambush me with little kids?"  I had realized that I could trick Bill Vickers and his crew into exposing their dirty tricks.    But then the showdown became a farce.  The child-troops were ordered to leave, and they scattered--the old men had no way of keeping them in straight lines or controlling where they ran to.  Middle-aged women, all public school teachers, had assembled on the tower platform and stood around, watching the anarchy and clucking their heads in disapproval.    "Imagine.  They can't even get the students to line up," one said.  "Wouldn't last a minute in public school," said another.    
4251 20060629181007 There was Sartre (he was just about 5'6" or so, with dark hair and strange piercing roving eyes).  A bunch of us were in the woodshed that needed cleaning out.  We were hauling stuff around and I desperately wanted to ask Sartre about Simone de Beauvoir -- what she was like as a person, what Sartre's true opinions of her and her thinking were, I really just wanted honest first-hand talk, not necessarily directed to any end -- but Sartre was there with another woman and I felt uncomfortable discussing de Beauvoir.  The woodshed looked beautiful, a change from the dingy and cluttered space we had entered into.  Now it was still dim, but the single bare bulb on the ceiling shone warmly on a clean-swept floor and white spackle buckets stacked neatly to one side. Everything stored in there, previously jumbled together without any organization, was now easily accessible.  We had thrown very little away becasue it all seemed mostly potentially valuable.  We had just organized it.  Someone had destroyed a vegetable garden I had made in a plot of land outside the house and Sartre recognized this.  Going through the strange amusement park-like outdoor area, seeing the netting enclosed spaces I at first thought were temporary hotels -- actually batting cages or bouncy ball pits, depending on the need.  I am with a young child, a group actually, who are acting destructively. I've got to gethtem outside so we can catch a ferry back to some mainland, and also so we can talk about respectful actions.  THe one kid I am physically nearest too ends up with some kid's baseball helmet in his hands.  He is like a stretched-out version of Javier Rios, but with more of an inner city kid swagger somehow.  We are almost by the exit so I make him go with me to the person taking up tickets.  He shoves the hat towards her, umbles something that gets her mad.  I step in to explain how he found the hat int he bouncy ball pit, how we would appreciate if she could turn it in to the lost and found, or let us know where it is.  "It's supposed to be out front by the telephones, but it hasn't been open since 2000," she says, taking the helmet.  We thank her.  On the way out I am asking the boy if he could tak about the difference between the way he interacted with the girl (her nametag said "Rhonda" or "Irrhonda") and the way I did but perhaps he is not understanding me because he doesn't even remember what girl I'm talking about.  On the other side we're walking past a huge port with big ships but because it is a long time after our bota was supposed to sail we think we've missed it.  Eventually I spot my dad -- he may have waited for us. On the boat sailing we see Laura Sobik, another woman with her spine visibile through her shirt, other men and women in a gym -- I start repainting an oil painting, just adding some bits.  THere is a sold piece of my mo's with the title -- "To My Friend, Who Loves These Spaces Too and Is Aware They May All Soon Be Gone".  I see only the back of the canvas with its rough sketch of a harbor scene.  The people int he gym and the oil painting of an aboriginal woman in straw hat surrouinded by green and yellow flowers -- all are part of a television series called "Makeovers without Surgery" -- except the word for makeover starts with a "p" somehow.  There is a small funny baby and her older sister. I am trying to make funny farting noises on the baby but someone's hands are over my mouth.  Some gathering (wedding?) at my Nanny's old place.  Looking through my Nanny's old house, everything stripped from the walls in anticipation of it going on market.  The back room where the washer and dryer used to be in larger and has a lead in that is walled but has no roof.  There are a strange set of stpes going down tot he basement that suddenly are cut-off.  There is no back wall.  We are thinking of buying the house but I am trying to figure out if all our art will fit in it.  We would have to make renovations to make this room useable but I am inriuged by the set of blocked stairs I never saw.  earlier: kitten running around in rectangular grass plot, about half of a football field long, enclosed by ground level stone wall, ancient. the kitten half-feral but friendly.  
4293 20060322093407 Amy Weidner in the house her dad had made.  Her room was on the top floor and overlooked the spot inthe backyard where her dad had installed, at her behest, a circular black fountain with two jets of water.  Her and her husband going to the Christian college.  She was going to get a fancy dining card with her married name on it (in the old fashioned way: "Mrs. Hugh G. Smith").  Rick was playing Roxy Music and Sun-Ra downstairs on the jukebox.  I was very grateful he had uploaded it so that I could now listen to it at work.  My cucumber seedlings were growing very strangely -- developing thier second, permanent set of leaves, but at the same time turning yellow.  We were at the beach in Nassau county somewhere.  I was waiting for Rick to get ready to go into the water.  Some frat type guy came over and was almost sitting on RIck, who was laying down in the sand, right by the edge of the parking lot, near a culvert.  Somewhere in the background our friends were gathering themselves together.  I kept saying, "Let's go swimming, let's go swimming."  Finally we ran down to the water but I had to pull off the yellow George Jones tee-shirt first.  Inside because it was August the sea was riddled with jellyfish.  I swam out slightly and got shocks that made my hands and feet feel tingly. They were just small jellyfish about the size of the fruits from the gum tree.  We were trying to pick the jellyfish out of the water and put them in buckets.  I wasn't sure that what we were picking up, which looked like miniature osage oranges with prickly chains like molecule models hanging off of them, was really waht was stinging us.  Mark Sloniker and Kirk were there, among others.  Now the sea had turned into a series of cabinets in an octogonal shape, but we could only see one half of the octogon-- the restwas on the other side of the wall.  You would think that inside the cabinet would be infinite, as each carried the sea, but when I looked inside it ended where a normal cabinet would end.  Some had a representation of the sea as a painting or other work of art.  In the back there were stairways that led mysterious places.  ONe led upstairs to a top-secret gallery of Kirk's.  Another led downstairs to somewhere I had been before --t he music section of the building.  What sounded like Linda from orchestra's voice was talking in a classroom to soem other lady, but it wasn't.  In between there was a horrible machismo novella / movie where two separate men renowned for their virility went out on pre-arranged dates. One, unhappy with how the date was proceeding -- bored of the woman, actually --  cast the woman down in her own house and left her there sobbing on the floor.  The other, on the couch with its brightly colored serape covering, listened impatiently as a woman in black hijab and full length skirt talked on the phone about how well things were going.  At some point he grabbed the phone from her, threwit ont he floor and threw her out.  She crawled away.   The man picked up a pillow angrily as if he would throw it after her, but the camera shifted to him gently placing it on the couch, and running his hands over it.  It was a sinister image.  There was a butler's pantry similar to ours, and Sarah had a big package of Easter mallow eggs.  There was an open package of 128 and for some reason I decided to break my Lenten vow to eat one, a green one.  I did see Linda from orchestra, and I was gnawing on a pork chop.  The pork chop, when I had gnawed it down, had beautiful carvings in it, like a totem pole, colored in black and white and red.  "Look," I said, "it looks like the Northwest Indians."  Linda took it to examine it more closely.  It turned big -- almost two and a half feet long, and ten inches wide, and covered with a sort of saddle covering of leather, white bone and polished wood, hinged all over with tiny silver hinges.  She opened the package and the bones of the porkchop fell out except they were all long femur bones stacked and bundled like sticks.  It looked like a reliquary.  She was about to throw the saddle covering away and I begged to be able to keep it.  I explained that Hill and Hollow had slaughtered the pig and this was the first time they had done it which is why the bones kept growing. 
4345 20060603093808 There was a small deer, more like an antelope really, that was a pet of someone's and was running around everywhere.  It was beautiful, but because it was disruptively running into people the owner felt she had to put it on a leash.  She got out one of those training leashes, but the animal was running far and wide.  Finally she put the collar and leash on but hte deer didn't see to know what to do.  It was crossed with a baby in a car seat carrier, putting various foam and plastic balls into its mouth.  The owner, now the mom, was telling it not to put the plastic balls in its mouth -- they were smaller than the foam / sponge ones and I guess she was worried the kid would choke on them.  I stood nearer the child to help it if necessary.  The child was telling me in a different language that the straps for its car seat carrier were chafing its skin.  I finally realized what it was saying and felt bad for taking so long.    We were in the backyard of my parents' house.  A bunch of my mom's family was over for some sort of holiday gathering.  My aunt Joanne was there, my aunt Barbara.  Inside my uncle James was watching television.  He came into the bathroom while I was in there getting salve for the baby outside and grabbed my elbow.  I didn't want to stay in there but I made an effort and did.  "You should really watch that show," he said.  Now I have forgottent he name but in my dream I had thought it was a different show (had misheard the name from the television set) until Iheard it spoken out loud.  I was trying to help find a cat that aunt Barbara had brought with them.  We were going to show our cousin Rachel the kepleton wiki?  Outside, I was goign back to the baby.  The ladder poised on the side of the house, directly in line over the baby carriage and the people sitting out back, fell as my dad tried to take it down.  It hit a pile of woo in front of the sheds and started a domino chain of falling and collapsing. Someone was driving away in an old station wagon through the woods (the ridge between our property / Blamey's).  There were a few old cars of ours back there and my mom was askign about a dent on one of them.  I went upstairs to put on shoes so I could help put away the piles of falen wood.   I shut the door atthe top ofthe stairs so the cat wouldn't get up there. When I got outside Sam, aunt Barbara and uncle James were leaving.  I cam out with the cat and let him go and he jumped in the car, into the trunk next to a guitar.  Sam was curled up in the hatchback (separate from the trunk).  We were looking up at two figures high up in the tree (the maple in the backyard in front of the shed, only it seemed closer to the driveway now, and much taller and fuller).  They were two monkeys -- they looked like macaques, except they had longs prehensile tails like New World monkeys.  Then there were more monkeys and someone was asking what they did up there, to which someone (me?) replied, "Oh, they hang around, round up a meal ..."  "Sometimes they catch a squirrel."  Indeed, a squirrel was walking by, oblivious.  A monkey poised its hand above it, missed. Then again it reached out for it and caught it.  Holding the squirrel to its side, the money looked at it.  The squirrel moved its face forward to try to kiss the monkey.  IT was a baby squirrel and thought it was a large squirrel. This made me sad and I almost couldn't look.  The monkeys were passign the suirrel back and forth, shaking it and playing with it.  Then another monkey came upt he side of the tree with another squirrel.  THe others all hooted and hollered and ran over to it, and most bizarrely, the squirrels started hissing and chucking, angry to see one another even intheir dire circumstances.  THe bigger gorup of monkeys wanted the solitary one to give up his prizze -- the two squirrels wanted to fight. I didn't relaly like seeing any of this, becuase it seemd that the solitary monkey would be forced off the edge ofthe tree because it would refuse to give up its squirrel -- it seemed the squirrels would fight each other to the death instead of trying to fight off their captors. But finally the solitary monkey realeased the squirrel when he was right at the brink of falling off -- and the other monkeys did theirs -- and they were fighting in shadow puppet style along branch. 
4428 20030323111008 per omnia saecula saeculorum   At a kitchen counter somewhere, I was scooping out bowls of low-fat ice cream for my dad and others, who all passed up the ice cream I offered them.  Finally,I got to my dad when we were driving in a car together with my mom.  My dad had invented the flavor I had dished out for him; it was a combination of rocky road, fudge swirl and golden vanilla, and I realized as I looked at it that it was supposed to resemble a painting of  Picasso's drawing of Stravinsky .  My mom didn't like the ice cream's taste, but I thought it was okay--kind of malty, but a little chalky as well.  My dad was remembering a time, a long time ago, when he'd been tired and had to drive himself home fromt he airport.  He was still bitter.  My mom said, "Honey, that was so long ago; can't you put it behind you?"  My dad said, "But I can still feel how my back felt that night."  We entered a house, where in the front hallway a man was trying on the long top half of a heavily embroidered  salwar kameez .  This one was beautiful--vey colorful, almost like an elongated peasant blouse.  "Too long," I told him.  In another room two very small raven-haired girls were playing. "Hola," I said to them.  They shyly said hello back.  As I talked to them I realized that one understood English while the other did not.  As I realized this, another man, with wild black curly hair and a swarthy face, approached us and stood in the doorway.    "She doesn't understand English," he said, pointing to the girl.  I talked to her in Spanish--"Hermanas?" I asked her, and then, "Es tu prima?"  But through eye contact alone I was able to learn that she ended up with this family because "they signed some papers right after she was born."   In an art room of a high school, I was trying to begin a drawing.  Someone--Georgia O'Keefe, very old--was talking with my mom about how all her paintings, no matter what the content, were actually landscapes, "exterior or interior," she said.  I had met a psychiatrist outside in the hallway and I'd made the apparent mistake of telling him I had no formal paid employment.  Now, while I was trying to sketch out my drawing--I wanted to incorporate a landscape with a stand of trees--he kept asking me whether I'd considered various job prospects, mostly in areas I had no interst in finding work.    I was copying an overdone watercolor of a forest scene; as I looked at it the colors changed and portions of it appeared and disappeared. The background of the painting went from the bright sun of high noon to the glow of after sunset, mirrored in the newly appeared reflecting pond at the base of the trees. I was trying to reverse the image when I drew it on my paper.  The psychiatrist man was telling me to do more with my life.  I was angry at him, and took out my anger on a boy who had snatched my drawing away, wanting to look at what I had done.  "I hate this place," I said to him, "and I'm leaving."  But my mom and others in the room convinced me to stay.  Then we were all leaving anyway, walking along a set of train tracks to the end of the line and a big gate.  I was at the head of the pack at first, uncertain whether I was walking in the right direction.  I saw Kevin, Sonny, and Javier, my students, and knew I was going in the right direction. Javier morphed into Jacobo, who was throwing things over the fence onto the railroad track--first a big kickball, then a small ball.  At the end of the railway platform I came up to him.    "Who's ball was that that you threw?" I asked him.  He shook his head, faux innocently.  "What ball, miss?"   "Jacobo," I finally said after about five minutes of this, "I am going to go back there and pick up my shoes"--my clogs were for some reason abandoned further up the landing.  "When I get back you need to tell me whose ball that was."  When I got back, though, we got on a bus.  We were mourning a dead man in the words of a dead language, singing the words of a song someone had composed in Latin, keening through the streets on a bus in the style of the ancient Romans.  I was sad, though I did not know why.  The man who composed the song told us, "Oh, that's alright.  You don't have to sing my lyrics."  So I began singing wordlessly, trying to express my grief for a man I did not know to a god of whom I was uncertain.  My friend Leilani was sitting next to me eating a bag full of raw peanuts. 
4450 20060612094808 (With my parents, dad at he ship-car's helm, rushing down the river that is always on the other side of the rock or tree or other boundary in other dreams.  In my dream I say to my sister, "What made me nervous about rushing down this river is that when I saw I realized it was soemthing Ihad seen before clearly in a dream.")  (I talk with my granny; she says that Chris didn't come home again the other night.  I tell her we are seeing Stefanie in a few days and Granny gets concerned wondering if Stefanie's cousin Justin (?) would need a Christmas present.)  Cleaning out the old dollhouse in my parents' house, I found a tiny version of Jorie Graham's  Hybrids of Plants and Ghosts , which I vowed to keep in my pocket and pull out to read whenever I got the urge to check the internets.  I was remodeling the dollhouse also, but first moving all the furniture and occupants to a lower level in order to start cleaning it up.      Amy Weidner had written in a sort of slam book I had started.  We were sitting in class and I was reading my little Jorie Graham book because everything was so boring.  Earlier I had run through the aisles of an enormous library rying to track someone down.  Later, in the auditorium of nowhere I had ever been, I was watching on stage as the performer began to sing a song.  Behind him, though no one knew this, some of the students had camped out in a tent.  Awakened by the music, one of them moved toward the front of the tent, peeked out hesitantly, then started singing.  The student's legs were cut off just beneath his hips.  He moved on over to the singer, tilted his head up to the microphone,a nd started singing.  The crowd is going wild.  The student is lifting up his hands, pointing at people, telling them to stand up and sing too.  People are getting into an assembly for the first time in a long time.  The student is telling some people to sing, others to sit down.  Then the principal intervenes, gets someone to pull the student off the stage.  The assembly stops.  A screen comes down over the stage and some emergency crowd-control footage of some stupid current music act is playing.  I am almost in tears I am so mad and upset.  I stand in front of the assmebly.  The words aren't coming right, but I say something like -- "I have every faith that we will move on from here and do things that are valid and important.  But right now, too, couldn't we stand up for times when one of us, right now, does something authentic, something true?"  I'm not even sure to what end I am speaking but I want people to think about, as I am, the worth of doing something authentic even if it is not permitted or not allowed to be completed.  And I want more and more people to do those things, and to support other people doing them.  But I am almost crying now -- I had to restart my first sentence becauce my voice broke as I was saying it. Everyone is exiting the auditorium anyway.  Force compelled them to stay there during all parts of the assembly except the student singing -- now the bell liberates them from the school day and sends them stremaing into the halls.  I head toward the back of the auditorium.  I look underneath one of the back seats.  It's a note from Will, Amy Weidner and Rachel Giordano, mostly saying silly things: "I am poet"; "Tip-tit-cheo" (that was Will's word for "okay") ... I notice the young music teacher standing int he middle of the auditorium and I go over to him.  "They won't allow a real student to sing, but they'll show this," I said, pointing to the on-stage screen on which a larger-than-life image of some latest voice manipulated, midriff exposing country star was singing.    "Makes me want to retire, actually.  But Customs has flooded the market with instruments."  "Really?  From where?  Canada mostly?"  "No, from all over.  International airports everywhere.  Tokyo, Nairobi ..."  One last bell rings.  It's the one that indicates a follow-up lecture on the performance (not the student's, but the guy he snag along with) today.  It's almost guaranteed to be pre-scripted and not even mention the student, positively or negatively.  "Do you think John will try anything at the lecture?" says the teacher, pointing to John Reviere.  "I doubt it," I say as my alarm clock goes off for the fourth or fifth time.  "That's what twelve or thirteen years of this straight does -- turns you into a peon in a society dependent on bells."    
4453 20030126114007 I want to ride on the Mag-Lev   Les, Rick's brother, was in the house of some old friends of my mom  and dad's.  We were all getting ready for a trip.  Les was packing up his belongings and I was giving away coupons for items that we never  use.  I came across an article about my sister Sarah in some sort of  college alumni/admissions magazine.  "Sarah Bellos," read the text below a picture of my sis, "has  impressed the recruiters with her many accomplishments: regency [in my  dream I understood this to mean a fine political balancing act, whereby one preserved the balance of power while simultaneously  ensuring that one got one's own way] in her affairs with her parents,  straightening and organization of shelves, a paragon to her older  sister, who is far less organized."  We were departing; we walked into the center of town, which looked  like the downtown of Scranton, PA, or a train station somewhere in the north of England.  There was a covered mall (in the sense of a  strolling area) in the center of town.  There, a huge tram--seventy or  eighty feet high--was attached to the roof of the mall with what  looked like heavy metal blocks. People were sitting in the center  compartment, which was about thirty feet high and well lit.  There  were three cars in the tram, each about thirty feet long.  The tram  hung suspended about five or ten feet on the ground, but it had funny  little white rubber tires, like you might see on an old-fashioned tricycle.    "It's a mag-lev," gasped the woman next to me, Nikki, in wonderment.  "Those big metal plates at the top are attracted to  another magnet in the ceiling, and there's another magnet beneath us,  in the ground." She started spouting facts about the mag-lev, most  of which seemed to be patently false.  But she prophesized, as well,  that many lawsuits would arise from the introduction of the mag-lev  into the unknown downtown of the unnammed city.  "Everyone will be  suing because it's very hard to draw up a schedule for the mag-lev.   It's also very hard to stop, so people will always be missing their  stops."  Cherry Jones was milling around somewhere in the background as a news  comentator.   We Must Prepare...for the Symphony   I was living in a ranch-style house on a suburban cul-de-sac.  It was  dark outside and fifty or sixty people were milling around in the  front yard, all of them ready to either preform in or attend an orchestra performance.  I was trying to arrange a way for everyone to  get to the performance.  We set up rides and many people departed, but  I was standing around waiting for a guy from Trevecca Nazarene to come  back with his viola.  We were in a large former theater--though I didn't realize that's what  it was until further on in my dream--trying to get to rehearsal.  A cleaning lady kept trying to kick me out.  My friend Laura Barrientos  was telling me that I could earn (or win, I don't remember) a bag of  candy if I was the person "with least demerits" for disobedience.  I  didn't care for a bag of candy.    I got into one theater, but the rehearsal was finished, and I only met  up with people who were putting their instruments away.  [By the way, "We must prepare...for the symphony" comes from a co- conspirator in high school orchestral antics, Mike Caravello.  Every  day before practice began, Mike would sit down, lift up his cello bow  with a flourish, and proclaim loudly, "We must prepare...for the  symphony..." (with a lot of accent on that first syllable of symphony).    Honky-Tonk Princess   We (Rick and I, my parents, my sis Kate, my sis Sarah and some boy,  other shadowy figures) were sitting in the living room of my parents'  home.  Kate was going to play us all a song.  "I'd like to play you all a song," she said, sitting on the rocking chair and strumming an  acoustic guitar.  "I call it...'Honky-Tonk Princess.'"  She started strumming, and singing, and it sounded good, kind of old- timey.  But then she looked at Sarah.  "I'd like to talk about how  stupid my sisters are," she said, in that tone entertainers use when  they're making small talk.  "Look at her," she said, gesturing towards  sis Sass, who was talking on her cell phone to someone she had some  sort of crush on.  "In love with a younger man."  And turning to me, she gestured off-handedly.  "And her...in love with  an older man."  "They should be like me," she said, launching into her song. "Smart."  
4509 20060128131808 I was riding my bike through the night through streets that were first deserted and scary -- then filled with youths who were milling about. Their mere presence in the street was threatening because there were so many more of them than me, all out at 3 a.m. with no apparent purpose. I had to dismount my bike to pass through the groups of people so as not to hit them -- I had been riding too fast and was in danger of careening into people who would suddenly dart into my way.  One of kids in the street, who looked strangely like Mike Nettles (?) from = high school, reached out and touched my head, roughing up my hair in a strangely affectionate, almost tender (in a non-romantic, sibling-like) way. =20  At Bryce's house (not the actual one; more like a house you'd find in suburban Jersey), I left the sunlit kitchen where I had been putting away plastic spoons of very small size (1/10 oz., 1/12 teaspoon) and talking with Bryce, and rode my bike down the road.  Down past the Red Lobster and the other big box eating and consuming establishments, I followed a paved path through a park.  A concrete path cut off to my left and I realized it led to where I had been last night, riding around. =20  I passed a group where a woman was loudly berating another woman with her two children. =20  "And they are so ugly and obviously worth nothing, those little pieces =2E.."  I couldn't hear everything.  I cycled slower as the woman with the children yanked them away and said loudly, "Come on, we're going home." The little girl had stringy brown hair and a slightly freckled, pale face with sratches around her eyes.  The older son had glasses and a slightly asthmatic wheeze.  I turned around on my bike and asked the woman if they needed a ride.  The woman responded with venom, yanking her children away as though I would contaminate them, spitting out that they certainly didn't need any help from me.  I was worried that her children, especially the little girl, were hurt, or at the very least tired and hungry.  The little boy was pleading with his mom, not in a whiny voice, but in the one of a small child who has to deal frequently with the whims of a capricious parent: "But mom, could we maybe get a ride = with SOMEONE?"  The mom, gesturing toward me -- I was still close enough to hear what she was saying -- said, "Who knows why SHE's offering us a ride.  Some misplaced sense of guilt?  Poverty of spirit or remorse over her own breeding.  Maybe just the fact" -- here she gestured toward me -- "that she is overweight".  For some reason this was the final straw for me.  I stopped my bike, turned it around, walked it back to them, the sickly-looking mom with her long processed black hair and her cigarette-thi= n body and her drunk clutch on her children's hands; the wheezing boy protective of his mom and sister; the girl with the festering scabs above her eye, who hadn't talked and whose head was drooping with tiredness.  "For the record, ma'am, I offered you a ride because it looked like your children needed it.  But apparently you don't want it for them.  I'm sorry."  I rode off, hearing behind me the boy pleading with his mom, "Couldn't we please just get a ride, Mom?"  It was only three blocks over that I realized it must have seemed silly to offer them a ride when I was on my bicycle.  But my car had been just back at Bryce's and I could have so easily ridden back for them.  Back at Bryce's I messed up as I was helping to fold laundry and wrap Chris= tmas gifts -- the cross-stitch Bryce's mom had made for the latest grandchi= ld, Sofia, had come out in the wash, and I spilled tea all over the floor, = getting several presents wet.  Bryce was making a list of things he'd have = to rebuy because of that and I tried to convince him I could get them.  It = was the Sunday before Christmas, which meant there were five shopping days = left.  Bryce left the room, obviously annoyed, and Kate, asking under her b= reath, "Is he normally like that?", suggested that we go out of the room an= d do something else for a while.  We were probably all hungry, I thought.  = Bryce's house was also the Office Max, where Corie Trancho and others worke= d.  Corie was in a pink smock and pants, stained with paint, but the other = employees were in bandeau tops and bikinis underneath smock jackets embroid= ered with the OfficeCo logo, for the "Bare Some Skin Day" sale, in honor of=  the unseasonably warm weather we had been having this holiday season.=20  
4512 20030812091208 dream of 8/10  We had stayed with our friends Marcela and Ray.  Somewhere there was a house with twenty rooms, a bathroom for each room, plus one extra.  It was my cousin's house and all my southern cousins were playing in it. The house seemed like it was lit by candlelight.  Outside, I checked the mailbox to find pages of an IEP packet that had been sent to me in a manila envelope.  there was no note, no explanation, not even a return address.  I recognized the page as the optional last page that you fill out when you have an annual review in special education.  I had received five blank copies of the page, one with observations, and one with notes scrawled in Mrs. Canas's handwriting.  I realized with a start that this day was the first day of inservice for school.  Then I remembered that I wasn't teaching anymore.  I got nervous for Marcela--did she realize she needed to be at school, too?--until I remembered that shewasn't teachng anymore, either.    I was shopping with my mom in an unstocked grocery.  The store was moving and the shelvers were not putting any new items on the shelf--just waiting for the old items to be purchased.  I was standing in front of an entire section for Hindu devotional candles.  In the same general vicinity were Chilean cherries, way out of season, and a strange, green coconut shaped fruit that had been mislabelled as a cherry.  It was larger than a cantaloupe with two bulbous halves, both pale golden yellow, flecked with red.  I turned the corner with my mom.  Beyond there was a small international cafe, a man selling candy from bins.  A woman held up a package of big flatbreads she'd found in her cart.  "These are yours, I think," she said, giving them to us.  We were walking together, my mom and I, to the unlit part of the store. The woman who'd found our flatbreads in her cart was ahead of us. "Somebody's been using my carriage," I said in my best Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear voices, "and they used it all up."  My student Eva appeared, shyly waving hello.  We were looking for perfumed floral soap for my dad, but all we could find was Guatemalan laundry soap.  dream of 8/11  I kept going back through the buffet line multiple times, stocking up, for some inexplicable reason, on the "natilla de santa lucia", which was disgusting pistachio/citrus flavored jello.  Outside, in woods that had the smell of early spring, we were setting up tents.  I was adding an extension to ours, a veranda made out of plastic bags.  But there was a storm coming and I would have to work fast to make it secure.  Then a large group of us was sitting in the open-air on folding chairs. I was collecting my belongings in order to leave for home with Rick.  Sis Kate had my coat, I hoped; she was going back to New York for a bit, but would be back before winter.  I looked behind me; there was a storm gathering in front of the seting sun, and another one in the northeast.  Brandon was sitting in the back row.  Everyone was getting up and filing over to a long set of concrete stairs.    At some point the stairs dumped us out onto another set of stairs inside a building.  By now the storm had hit outside; we could hear it on the roof of the building.  I had been separated from everyone, though I kept catching glimpses of people.  I was walking the stairs alone; suddenly they started descending sharply.   I had a choice of two diferent sets of stairways to follow, and I chose the set that ended in nothingness at each level.  Rather, they flight of stairs would end before making contact with the next floor and the next set of descending stairs.  So I had to jump, repeatedly, from flight to floor to flight--not a far distance, maybe three feet over and five feet down--but at dizzying heights.  The stairs where I was walking were some seventy or eighty feet above ground.  I made it to the main level.  My friend Mark Sloniker was working in a shop on the ground floor.  I said hello quickly and walked around to the other entrance for the building.  A man drove his car through ceiling-height glass automatic doors.  I went through the ones next to them.  They read "ultra low-energy powered doors".  That meant you had to push them open.    I was in the parking lot of my middle school.  It was May, late spring,  but the storm had come, blanketing everything in ice.   The wind was cold and brisk, and there were sheets of ice everywhere.  I was sad because all the crops were going to die because of the night of frost. 
4529 20030223113408 I want to be a hobbit   I ran with another in my company through the woods behind my parents'  house, grown into a true and boundless forest.  There had been clearing  in this part to build small footbridges and paths.  We ran through the  woods, needing to hide.  We'd escaped from captivity and we couldn't afford to hide in the same  place we were captured before, a wooded copse near a small footbridge.   Instead we fell to the ground and started burrowing first into the  leaves, then into a small cave-like rock formation not more than two  feet off the ground.  We had special elfin capes which supposedly could  camouflage us, but they did not work for my companion, who moved or  otherwise gave himself away.  A young republican pretty-boy type was responsible for his capture.  He led him back away to the evil camp.  I stayed still among the leaves and  overhang for a very long time.  Then I moved cautiously down the  footbridge and ran straight on to Blamey's field, the plot of abandoned  land and houses that in real life sits next to my parents' house. Something was different.  All the houses seemed in much better repair  than usual; the bright blue chicken coop was still rotted away, to be  sure, but the other buildings looked near to orignal condition.  There  were no condominiums up at the top of the hill.  Instead, clumps of  trees and large rocks dotted the slope.  I spotted a building I had  never seen before; dark brown, it had the same layout as a ship's prow.   It had a top deck about twenty-five feet long andwas about fifteen feeet  tall.  There were two main entrances on either side of the back of the  prow; the impression I got was that of the bedrooms in the Blameys' real  house, where two small bedrooms on the top floor were stuck off to two  opposite sides of the house and connected by a small, wall-hugging walkway.  Somewhere in my head a warning rang out.  Night had fallen and the  interior of the house burned with a strange, warm glow.  Although the Blameys had lived there happily years ago, now an evil force was in the  house; it enticed people to come in and pick up an object from the  Blameys' life. After a person picked an object up, the evil force was  able to work control her mind and make her do its will.  I hurried on  past the house.  Somewhere on a farther slope there was a failed town  project, a community park.  A playground, complete with impossibly high- seated swings, stood vacant and forlorn in the misty night.    The voice in my head was warning me about the people I saw setting up  tents--they were mainly in the service of the house and the evil force,  the voice told me.  Yet I needed a place to stay the night, especially  now that I was suddenly travelling with the Galvan/Gonzalez family,  students of mine and their mother.  We wound up seeking shelter in a tarped-over lean-to.  Four men were inside; they knew I was training to  be a printmaker and so they asked me to help them with printing out some  publicity materials.  An actual bed was the printing bed; we laid  already inked images on the bed and lay fresh sheets of paper on top of  them.  Then we transferred the ink from one paper to another using  pressure.   At one point the man I was working next to asked for a utility knife and  I admitted that I didn't have one.  "Just go next door [to the haunted  house] and grab one," he suggested, innocently enough.  But I had sensed  that he was already in the service of evil; he and his friends all had a  faint, will-o'-the-wisp glow.  I pulled out a pair of scissors and said,  "These will have to do."  We got the printing done.  I could feel the  evil house's presence as thought it breathed out loud in the night; it  felt like it was moving closer to our shelter, or drawing the shelter  nearer to it.  One of our company, a small boy about three or four, had to go to the  bathroom.  Someone suggested taking him into the haunted house  but I  quickly grabbed him.  We went out front; somehow it was the front of a  ranch syle house.  The kid went to the bathroom.  There was a dog on a  chain of uncertain length; we were trying to stand out of reach of it.   Suddenly I knew we had to get back to the shelter; evil forces were coming.  I grabbed the boy and tried to run.  It was almost too late;  some pice of material or rubber rope bound us to the side of the house.   A tall figure with beast head and curved ram's horns, in a long black  cape, red lined and kept close around him, had appeared.   
4567 20060604115608 an awkward meeting.  i go off with a lady towards the beautiful lake, once a valley, now flooded.  we are going to walk along the dock pathways that crisscross and even transverse the lake's circumfrence. there's one branch that hugs the shoreline from where we just come and follows it as the wooded shoreline extends outward in a spit -- i dont want to follow that path, site of the meeting just a few minutes before.  there's also a path that passes where we came from but continues on past that point in the opposite direction of the first path.  this path seems safe -- open air and land.  then there is the path i want to follow which goes straight out into and across the lake, under the sky where in the center it is windy and strong and just yourself surrounded by water. make a move to go that way but it is just then that the lady says something along the lines of "It's too bad we can't walk that way because of the water."  looking down i see the path where we are walking, poured concrete somehow floated on top of the surface of the water, is partially submerged in the direction i was going to choose to walk, and dips even deeper into the water farther on, so that we would have eventually been walking through water way above our heads.  so i follow the lady in the perpendicular direction though the pull of that other path is strong.    walking along i realize that the concrete path really isn't on any sort of foundation -- it is moored to some point on the lakebed but it can swing back and forth.  i notice that either side of the path is now beginning to be covered with water, almost as though the path were curving with the high point in its center.  this makes it a bit more difficult to walk now as we must try to find the balance point in the curved surface.  i am trying to do this but find myself more and more losing my balance.  finally it is too much and i am slipping off the side and into the water.  my companion is trying to grab me but she too loses her balance and falls in.  we are trying to get up but it is very hard to find a spot to grab onto in order to launch ourselves up.  also there is that slightly gross feelign you get swimming too close to the docks or pylons -- fear of dark unseen spaces, growth on the underside.  next part unclear: we are part swimming back, part hoisted up by a crew. hoisted up on land, we walk by the skeleton framework of other docks, these partly made of wood, showing their underwater architecture.  i look and tell the lady that we should remember how they are made so that we can get out the next time we are in a similar situation.  then the lady is hilda (?) and we are walking through a corridor of people.  we are dripping wet and i am pretty embarrassed to be in only kate's mustard yellow saint anthony's shirt.    perhaps then i am trying to go somewhere to buy clothes?  the strange dollar stores -- not quite open yet, but when i peer inside to see the hours the young man lets me in.  the cuts of meat just sitting out, on top of broiler pans of water on top of hot plates, a makeshift catering setup, except these are standard lunch plates for people, who will jsut come in and buy a plate of meat for lunch.  i am trying to get downstairs to where i had seen fabrics, notions, clothing.  there are more dining set-ups downstairs.  it is part of a sort of house that is magical, haunted maybe, or full of history.  we are allowed to explore it but not any part that is dead-ended or cordoned off.  we are walking through one section that is like a buffet and chamber music hall --  we see the owner, who congratulates us for getting this far and rearticulates the rules of exploration.  i walk up one set of wooden stairs -- at the landing the section to the right deadends after a few more steps, the other section goes up to another portion of the house, cordoned off (that part has a feeling of mystery).  two young women are conversing in the dead end section (and one can see behind where they sit how a door has been blocked off and a passage sealed off).  a man with grey hair, mussed up, crazy eyes, powerful build tall, not stocky, comes up the stairs.  there is a weird wax light to the whole area though i see no light source.  i am not sure where this man can want to go.  he opens his trenchcoat and it is clear he is malevolent, something more than an exhibitionist.  i am trying to figure out how i will combat his evil which has already paralyzed the two women with fright.  the best thing may be to kick him until he falls down, i reason. 
4668 20030407095207 Rick and I are walking around the bend of a residential street. President Bush just has said something that made him look like a buffoon and me feel sad.  Television screens are everywhere, carrying replays of the mis-step.  I have to ride back home on a bike down treacherously dark twisty country roads.  At first I am in a car and it was still daylight--I am trying to figure out where the mirror was on which my friend Corie had left directions on how to get back via "Briley Pike".   Off the country roads and on the busier but less curvy streets of a large town, I am knocked off my bike by a pothole and almost run over.  I drive up a long and shadowy hill, the driveway to my home.  There is a masoleum at the top, and inside, a concrete bed with sets of chains secured in it.  There's a set that's obviously for a body--two for arms and two for legs--and another, single chain that more inexplicably rises upright from just off center of the bed.  There is a young man ranting and raving on the bed.  He is my brother.  His mother is beside him, trying to talk reason to him, but he won't listen.  He is calling down curses on himself, and they are appearing in ridiculous gothic-style letters beneath him, like a Goth closed captioning service.    "May I be struck by every living thing, and every non-living," he rails against the clear sky.  I can see stars floating far above silhouetted branches.  My brother-son chains himself to the concrete bed, knowing that soon his curse will begin to be fulfilled.    I hear hideous screams--the screams of the devil, arriving to begin to fulfill the curse.  I have to hide somewhere, but where? I float up to the chimney; I am floating rootless in the night.  The devil will rend the self-cursed man apart, but the man's curse is that he must endure it all and still live.  I am still floating, but the sun has risen and it is a brilliantly sunny Mediterrenean day.  Below me are the archipelagos of clay-colored islands and the brilliant teal sea.  I am grasping the branches of an enormous cedar of lebanon, floating over an enormous precipice.  I keep gliding from branch to branch, but my goal is really to drop down to the sea. The branches I am holding turn to tubers like enormous sweet potatoes.  I break them off because I want to fall into the ocean, far below.  As I fall, I try to make myself as inconspicuous as possible by falling fast and compressing myself into a ball.  I don't want to be like someone else, who was eliminated by being captured by some governmental group as soon as he was found in the water.  I swim behind a french tanker wall, bamboo screened; for some reason they will not find me here.  I look down and find I am wearing a turquoise blue skirt--the mark of a special group that lives in the sea on the fringe of society.  We are taking care of small (half-inch tall) dogs--"love puppies," they are called.  The French have perfected them and I think they are really some sort of mind control--they make the people that come into contact with them docile.  I can't find out whether they have been developed for benevolent, benign or malevolent purposes.  The U.S. doesn't know that the French have succeeded in creating them; the U.S., to, wishes to make them, but they deny out loud to the rest of the world that they can exist.  The dogs we caress and feed "magic blue drops" from tiny bottles with tiny eyedroppers--they are small and beautiful, real and lovable--I know the tiny dogs are like soma in Brave New World.  We truly love these dogs and caring for them is our true purpose.  All of us here on this tanker in the middle of the ocean, with nowhere else to go, are glad to have been accepted by the French, to wear our blue skirts and to care for these love-puppies.   "Because our world is not the same as Othello's world. You can't make flivvers without steel-and you can't make tragedies without social instability. The world's stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can't get. They're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they practically can't help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong, there's soma. Which you go and chuck out of the window in the name of liberty, Mr. Savage. Liberty!" He laughed. "Expecting Deltas to know what liberty is! And now expecting them to understand Othello! My good boy!"   Aldous Huxley,  Brave New World    
4769 20030319104608 I tried a couple of times to be the round peg, round hole guy  But I was always way too square   My family was in a house I'd never been in before--the closest I could describe it would be my Aunt Regina's house superimposed on my Aunt Joanne's.  We were gathering for Easter.  At least two waves of people had gathered, regrouped and then rapidly left the house again.    I was going to play music for my cousins and sisters and the "tabla"--it was actually one of those touristy  dulcimers  found in Nashville novelty shops along Broadway...with sheet music that you slip in under the strings and a funny pick with a picture of Elvis on it.  But I misplaced that pick and wound up with one made out of a shark's tooth.   I didn't really know any songs, and as I was trying to select something, I simultaneously was trying to get a road map and directory for a young man who wanted to know the driving time and route to Fargo, North Dakota.  One of my cousins was making molded chocolates for some sort of holiday gift.  There was another mass exodus from the house--all the cousins left.  I was the only one remaining, and I was in another room with a canopy bed looking through my sister Sarah's pile of photos--she had a bunch with her and her sorority sisters all decked out in costume jewelery, early 80s makeup and a smorgasbord of Sassy's pastel oversized glasses from her sixth- and seventh-grade years. Each sorority sister had on at least two pairs of Sarah's seemingly endless supply of turquoise, hot pink, and gold framed, 3-inch diameter lensed shatterproof glasses.  My mother was calling me from the landing of the steps downstairs.  An uncle who I hadn't seen in over a decade--but who looked like a tall version of my Uncle John--had arrived with his new wife and two children.  I called his wife by the wrong name when I embraced her--but she corrected me gently as I did so.  I don't even know if she heard me.  My uncle's first wife had died in childbirth almost fifteen years ago, on Christmas Day.  "And that's why we haven't seen him for fifteen years," said my Aunt Joanne.  "I think he blames me for her death."    always one step off, always one beat behind   The scene shifted again.  Someone named Chris Bailey was taking me around; we were going to a show his band was playing.  Flashing before my eyes was a series of shorts from an instructional filmsrip on selecting a fishing boat.  All of these fishing vessels were actually underwater research vessels--"for the serious amateur fish enthusiast."  The one I finally settled on looked like an enormous beluga blimp--over 300 feet in diameter, with a tiny set of "fins" to steer it at the back, and a big round porthole of an eye.  It was painted black and white.    Researchers aboard the craft received a PDA-looking device and two styli.  We amateurs, the filmstrip continued, would receive just one stylus--which we would use, however, in exactly the same manner as the researchers.  We'd tap it on the porthole and fish would come, thinking it was something to eat.  (They'd believe the type of feedfish they were about to gobble up was "prat", to be precise.)    As we saw a fish we'd record it.  The whole purpose was to determine the stores of various species of fish.  How we would account for double visits, I didn't know.  I was in the small club where Chris's band was going to play; people were still setting up, and a small crowd was gathering. It was late afternoon and the club was lit by filtered sunlight and a single dim bulb.  It was still Easter Sunday afternoon.  I could see the porthole of the boat through some sort of screen and I was using the stylus to record the fish I counted on a small piece of duct tape on the back wall of the low stage.   Each fish was like a single ray of light falling through the  night of the deep black sea.  I was trying to record each light individually as they cavorted and spun and fell.  Each little light was like a life of its own and though there were very many of them, I could see and feel each one individually.  It was very sad and yet very beautiful to count lives one by one like that, as they fell through the sea like sparks in the night sky.  Then the show was about to begin and I was embarrased to be up on stage, counting things that didn't matter to anyone else.    Some women I knew were skanking in the back but I was embarrased to join them--though Chris Bailey himself was skanking rather haphazardly and uncoordinatedly on stage.  I stood next to a crowd to the side of the stage--a late-twenty something guy with funny blond Pauly Shore hair was trying to get me to drive home with him. "No," I said.  "I have a boyriend, and besides, Chris Bailey will give me a ride home."            
4841 20030512094808 deux ex machina   The computer was going wild--well, not really; it was just using too much CPU.  We were trying to check something in a program and nothing was happening--instead, a wildly fluctuating EKG-like line was pulsating and percolating all over the screen.  "That's it," said Sebastian, Rick's friend.  "Time for some biofeedback."  He shut off the computer.  A ghostly glow lingered for a second, and then a screen mirroring the pattern of his own heartbeat appeared.  He breathed slowly and the line began to level off.  He traced it with his hand, then traced again where he wanted it to be.    Later my family and I were walking through an old meat packaging plant, the Neuhoff Center, which had been transposed to a spot simultaneously in the woods behind my parents' house and in the deep mud of the harbor's low tide.  Now I remembered--the old abandoned chicken coop I used to play in in the woods had once been part of the packaging plant. I wanted to go there again--but we were going to the water.  A dirt road separated the wood side of the plant from the harbor side.  We crossed the road and glimpsed, in the underbrush beyond the shore, a sunken silo and a spiral staircase.  I climbed the staircase, passing two signs in foreign languages on my left as I went up.  One read something like "Public lands" and the other, "Caution needed"--in Portuguese and I do not recall the other language.  My family was hesitant to follow me--my mother walked twenty paces behind me, though, and our neighbor Marian followed he eagerly. At the top of the winding staricase was an observation platform--from here you could see more sunken silos, half submerged in the harbor mud. A second floating dock lay beneath us.  Our dock was surrounded by rusted iron railings, about hip high. In the mud below us, great rushes grew.    I wanted to see the silos more closely and I wanted to smell again the tangy smell of the low tide.  I climbed down to the second deck.  In the rushes, great sucking gashes of mud, five or six feet long, were opening up onto the surface of the harbor, being covered with clear water, and closing up and pushing themselves to the surface again, over and over. I saw it happen in the same place three or four times and then I started to notice it elsewhere.    Suddenly I glimpsed, darting through the rushes after the mud ravine had closed, a six-foot long  coral snake , swimming black red yellow under the surface of the now murky water.  Underneath the water it glowed almost shell pink.  I was filled with desire and revulsion--I wanted to get close to the snake, to see it moving silently under the water with the jerky and sinuous movements of snake's swimming, and I wanted to get as far away from it as possible--it could leap out of the water and bite me and kill me if it wanted to, I felt. The snakes were leaving now, in twos and threes, with the certaintude of a sinisted hunting party.  Everyone now was clustered on the floating dock.  The snake was black yellow red yellow banded, I noticed.  My dad was standing next to me, reciting an old poem that he had changed: "Black and red, you won't be dead...yellow red black, it won't attack..."I looked at him in horror, realizing it really was a poisonous snake. I felt woozy, like I was going to fall into the water.  I grabbed onto an iron railing that extended down from the top deck; my head was spinning like it doees when you sit on a tire swing and twirl around with your head hung back. Marian and my mom were sharing stories by the edge of the dock.  "You're the only woman who knows my secrets," my mom was telling Marian, almost crying. Marian was leaning back, back--precariously poised over the reeds where the snakes had emerged.  "That's it," she said. "I'm going in."  I tried to stop her but she had squatted facing us on the edge of the deck and now fell into the rushes silently first her back and her bent legs and tucked head following. She disappeared for a second beneath the murky water--I was worried that she had sunk into the mud--I'd seen it six feet deep as we'd climbed the spiral stairs.    But she reemerged in the clean water beyond the rushes. I called to her, pleading with her to return to the dock.  I could see, close to us, another coral snake shooting off, swimming beyond her and then turning back to circle aoruns her.  I kept calling.  Marian came within reaching distance.  The snake was at her neck.  I pulled her up, but not before the snake became a man and launched a poison dart of venom at her.  I grabbbed a tire to fend him off.  He could stand upright in the water, swimming, and he had a funny plated head.  He was going to spit venom at me.  I held up the tire to deflect the gob of spit, but a portion of it hit me with a sting like a dart's, just under my right ear.  
4858 20060702123209 The false king, sitting at the falling-down picnic table in the middle of the clearing in the wood, an old camp site, was able to heal by turning his back on someone and radiating energy from his shoulder.  The old wizard / bard had materialized and was sitting at another bench or rock some forty feet away from the king.  In fact this wizard was by blood more closely linked to the line of kings and was indeed more powerful than the false king but he kept up the facade of the king's rule, waiting for the true heir to the throne to reappear.  I was a young girl aware of these dynamics; the old wizard was like a father figure to me and I was his apprentice.  I could see how annoyed the false king was that we had appeared on the scene (the wizard had teleported himself there, half-hoping not to find the false king there, but expecting that he would).  I went over to the false king because the wizard needed his back healed.  The king came over and turned his back the wizard and I felt the air grow warm as energy spread from one back to the other.  I needed my shoulder fixed too but I was reluctant to ask the king.  But somehow he sense it? or the wizard did? and the king gave me a little jolt to my shoulder blade, our backs just touching.  Then my sisters were telling me the news that our dad was in the hospital, not expected to live, and I was holding a broken plate, the white ones that Rick used to have with the turquoise blue and lime green around the edges.  I brought that to the king -- in fact the pieces were like wings and in my head they reminded me of shoulder blades that needed to be joined together -- I wanted him to heal the broken pieces, rejoin them to one plate, and in doing so heal my father and save him from death.  I needed only to hold the plate near the king and hold the pieces together -- but now they were in three parts, the third a small triangle near the top.  We were supposed to make grand entrances through a gathering of family members but everyone was taking my ideas (somersaults, headstands) and doing them before I could.  Even Leah Meussig was there, trying to do somersaults, and my mom tried to do a backwards tuck and roll. Plus there was not even any room to walk in the three rooms my family was crowded into.  Finally I just walked in, curtsied and sat down.  My nanny applauded me.  "Just like a southern lady," she said.  I didn't even btoher to protest that I hadn't gotten to perform what I had planned, that the curtsey was in itself a form of protest.  A man was talking about how he didn't like the more elaborate, staged introductions, like the one he claimed I had been in, a marriage of Bottom and Titania.  "That wasn't me," I said, "that was my sister Kate. I didn't think it was too good either, because it was too long."    There were all sorts of books in the rooms off to the side, including a strange pornographic version of Archie comics from the fifties.  I went into another room to get something and wound up in my mom's school, which had been remodeled or completely rebuilt.  My mom wasn't there, but Ellen Kaskoun was.  My friend was looking for some stationery to write thank you notes on and I thoguht I had some in my bag, but they were all envelopes.  "I've got something," Ms. Kaskoun said, and went into the back.  She returned with lined composition books, the paperback types, with extra composition paper.  Some of the pages were filled with little kid writing already.  "I love these sorts of books," I said, "I have tried to be penpals with people on them."    I went downt he hall to find my mom's classroom.  The doors were incredibly high, at least eleven feet.  One of the doors said "Kate" to let my young sister, kindergarten age, know that that was the classroom where she should wait for my mom each day after school.  My mom's calssroom was brand new, I found out when I opened the door with my old house key ont he red lanyard, almost ripping out the lock mechanism as I took the key out.  I was trying to feed it back in when my student Veronica appeared.  "Is that shirt made with vegetables?" she asked, pointing to my shirt, which i had made with natural dyes.  I could tell she thought it was very beautiful.  "Yes, do you remember who I am?" I asked, and she did not, but as I was asking I realized I should have focused more on her interest in the shirt, let her know more about how it was made -- in order to pursue her interests rather than mine.  I didn't have my galsses on, so the most memorable fature I had was not present. Ilooked at Veronica again.  "Do you remember how I used to be your teacher?"  Her slow smile appeared.  "I do!  I do remember!"  My mom came around.  There was another entrance to her classroom and she said, "They must have come in this back way because they didn't know about the other door." 
4899 20030302105208 forty more days of winter   With my sister Sassy I am crossing 21st, transformed into a major road  of four lanes either direction.  There is a festival on Vanderbilt's  campus, a street festival like you might have just before Ash Wednesday.   The back alley entrance is full of people from the Valley.  This back  alley section is free; we are not going to get a ticket and walk in, but there is a lot to see just walking by.  The day is bright and sunny and throngs of people are here, pushing us along.  There is a tent wall of  booths and then an entry way to the larger carnival.  At the end of the  row of entrance booths there are the backs of several brick dormitory  buildings.   Suddenly I am with Rick and we wind up in front of them, uncertain how to get in.  One woman climbs in through an open window and I'm about to suggest to Rick we do the same--only we are surrounded by other festival goers, hundreds of them crowded around us and the backs of these brick buildings.  Another woman exits through a screen door just in front of  us so Rick and I enter the brick dormitories through the same.  On the other side there are the well-manicured lawns of houses, some  campus information booths and a large wooden platform.  Rick goes off to  do something else and I explore the circular platform.  It is meant to  be a treehouse, I think.  There are winding steps that circle the entire  platform; their total rise is no more than two feet, the distance that  the second platform that they lead to stands off the the first.  Rick is  shouting something at me--he wants me to look at the address numbers on  a swing on the porch of a building across the lawn.  I look and cannot  spot what he is talking about at first--then I see the same swing that,  in this dream at least, I know I've seen in other dreams.  It is a giant  platform, maybe 30 feet by 20 feet, hung with "vines"--strong cables-- that are attached to a tree that I cannot see.  The platform is  suspended not only above ground, but in mid-swing, so it is impossible  to tell whether it was still swinging back or whether it was making its  return.  The numbers 1 and 9 have fallen off its original "1849" affixed with  metal housefront style numerals.  I look to the street to the right of  the platform I'm standing on, trying to figure out whether I've seen  this deja-vu platform before.  The street to the right is Chet Atkins  Boulevard.  Some woman is walking though the platform I'm standing on, shouting,  "Set your watches back. It's time for daylight savings time to end."  I  think she's a bit early.  I am trying to figure out how to print on silk.  There is a series of  advertisement posters I want to make: on the one hand, the posters will display the benefits of printing on silk; on the other hand, they will  be beautiful and drapeable.  Somehow I am talking with Clarissa, a woman I know. She is trying to  sketch out a poster design.  She is taking a lot of medication so it is  difficult for here to get proportions right--she is drawing a clock, but  the face is somewhat lopsided and she claims that she cannot fill in the  top half correctly at all.  She places the 12 and 6 in opposition to  each other, but places them where the 11 and 5, respectively, would be  on a normal clock.  She claims she's only going to fill in the bottom half, and she begins to do that, in her shaky spidery handwriting.  I  think of a note I found [in real life] the afternoon before.  Clarissa's  handwriting reminds me of that of the writer of this small note; the  content of her poster, of the letters of the alphabet up to p printed  painstakingly on a small handmade grid, each letter to its own square,  on a piece of heart-shaped paper.  Leilani from Untitled comes in; she's worried that we haven't heard from  the guy who is working on designing our posters.  She suggest that maybe  we should design them on our own, but I tell her I think that it's unprofessional to tell the guy who's designed our posters, after he's  already spent time making them, that we're refusing them without looking  at them.  I'm back with my sister Sarah and we are trying to figure out how I super-saturated some plants I have rooting in a jug of water.  Somehow  when I pull them out of the jug and then re-immerse them, they start  gushing and showering water from their leaves and stems.  I'm driving home down Broadway, but it seems like a major two-lane  interstate.  The rain I've been driving through for hours turns to snow;  some people are skidding, and some cars abandoned by the side of the  road are spurting water from their undersides.  I avoid a large van and  an a mid-sized car catty-cornered in the left hand lane, jutting out  into the right lane.  People are driving the wrong way down this road;  the horn on the car doesn't work very well.  But overall the car is  handling well. 
4941 20060328114808 The same feeling all these past nights of sleep like weight on top of me, falling through air that hinders movement like water and as I fall or hang suspended the time of the everyday, linear time, falls away and it is unchanging time, circular time that emerges.  An old old unchanging language, a common language being spoken and I remember it enough to recognize it but I don't understand it.  We are in a house that is our own but it is an ancient house and we are its much more than it is ours.  03/27/2006  The spider by the side of the bed had a large fang like a bird's beak and iridescent blue tufty material under its chin.  It reminded me of a tropical bird. It was building its nest just a foot under where we lay our heads.  We had to trap it but in what.  I went to get a glass artichoke jar from the bathroom -- I used them for necklace storage.  But it would be too small for the spider -- not because it was so large (though by now it was about a half-inch long), but because Rick would have to get so near to trap it.  For some reason I was not to get near the spider, I think because I had already gotten a bite.  So the artichoke jar proving insufficient I went back to the bathroom and got a large empty pickle jar.  Surely this would be suitable.  But when I returned I saw that the spider had changed into many small spiders, jumping and trailing silk, in a different part of the room. This dream came true in a trivial way when just after I woke up my sister and I were in the kitchen and were both startled by the cave cricket, scurrying spider-like, across the floor and under the stove, only to emerge several minutes later from underneath the fridge.   03/28/2006  We were in the old house in the side stairwell we hadn't known existed. Sarah had lost her phone and Kate and I went into the large hangar like room where TAG Art Gallery had set up.  My thought was to call Sarah's phone and listen for it ringing, but there was no phone there I could see.  Then my mom turned one up under a pile of stuff but it was right by the main desk and I was afraid to use it.    Later I was looking for a house among the ones on the "street" -- actually a hallway with linen and clothes closets on the otuside of each house.  i went into some houses unbidden and snooped around to see if they would be suitable.  They all had the geometric and wood-panelled layout of futuristic homes of the seventies.  In one house a couple lay on the bed and I could see photos of them from their more youthful days. In the last apartment / house on the block I peeked through the crack inthe door to see a large loft-like space with bright posters and design everywhere.  I went inside.  I had thought just men lived there but there was a vibrant older woman from Spain who I spoke with, trying to figure out if I could live there.  THen the space turned into a shop and a whole troop of us, including my frined Hilda, were on line waiting to have our purcahses rung up.  Except people kept getting in front of me online, but that was okay because I was turning around to talk with people who I recognized int eh shop.  I saw my friend Danielle's mother, and then Danielle and Doriet and others.  Danielle's mom was buying a ridiculous assortment of cheap jewelry, all on a single cardboard card -- mismatched earrings that doubled as necklaces, and had some word like "fill-ins" that referred to them.  I was worried because I could not find the package of cards I was supposed to be buying, so I took everythign out of my backpack, including lots of junk, but still couldn't find it.  I piled my library books to the side.  But I reasoned that I might have brought the cards home already.  The other people int eh goroup were getting restless.  We were supposed to be driving to Chicago for an afternoon there, and it was already getting close to 4 o'clock.    Finally I reached the head of the line but when I got there the guy pointed to a bucket full of raffle tickets with numbers ont hem.  It ook this to mean that I should tkae a number but they weren't in any sort of order and there hadn't been any instructions to do so.  But I took one and started piling up my library books.  Hilda helped me to make sure that they were in two even stacks.  The top books were on Native American life and habitat, but there were also books of poems and a bunch of histories of Soviet collectivization.  When I got to the counter this time, the guy looked me up and down and said, "You're very depressed, I can tell."  I was upset and hurt by this.  Earlier, we had a big party at our Fairfax house and people kept coming in the front door, including people we hadn't expected.  We let them all in and when I stood between the two rooms looking over one sleeping person I was filled with compassion, but when I looked back across the room to where Rick was watching me with some concern I was filled with sadness and remorse. 
4945 20031124103607 21 Nov  1)A voyage on foot in British Columbia (or maybe Alberta), the edge of the world, where ships fall off the end of the sea.  Walking up the steep and gravelly slopes to the very top, where surveyors stand, gazing down the severe cliff face to where the rocks were eaten up by the sea, far below.  The sky the color of slate--the gravel quartz-white, shiny and hard to walk on in my clogs.  A surveyor from Australia stops me, tries to convince me to go out with him.  We sit on a ridge by the edge of the cliff, a seat in the wall with the raging sea beneath us.  2) A trip to Debbie Iberger's house--first past hte party that the Anguiano's are having for Jeli's childhood friend, who also had Downs' Syndrome.  Ont he slight hill at the beginning of Old Post Road--made larger or even existent in my dream--children are riding on crested waves, the whole road is swallowed in sea water.  Inside Debbie's house, quilts on the wall tell a story of hardship and perseverence--they are part of a modern crafts movement.  We have to go to another party, and so we leave.  3) Driving by the Mount Sinai harbor with my mom, my Aunt Joanne, my cousin Rachel and sister Sarah, and somehow most importantly my sis Kate.  We drive past the harbor--on our right a solid black cliff face, on our right, at the water's edge, fantastic wind-carved sculptures--monoliths at the base, whittled away at the top to suggest fantastic shapes--dogs becoming birds, men riding other animals, women transformed into landscapes and warriors.  4) Inside a cafeteria with the people from the dream aboce--Mark Sloniker had some sort of cash prize.  22 Nov  1) At Landrum.  Myself, very skinny, moving like a daffy white girl.  A holiday-type luncheon celebration.  I drop off some desserts, although I wasn't going to--but then I was glad I had, for there weren't many there.  I wanted to go back to my classroom, which I had just moved into--my fourth classroom switch in one year.  Talking with the secretary, an old office worker from my old elementary school, about my classroom reading program.  2) Mrs. Wallace's classroom (my first grade teacher).  Her classroom moving sale: she was actually moving this time, although she had this sale annually, five years in a row now, to keep the memory of her husband alive, as well as for a host of reasons she'd written down (some in Latin, from an ancient Mass for the Dead) on a laminated sheet of paper.  3) Walking with the learned old historian/archaelogist.  A team of us walking to the building in the woods, one of the oldest in the US.  In the 1600s, the Ithaca Symphony, the first symphony in the US, had performed there.  The building existed beneath the ground, a network of tunnels--there was some question as to whether it existed at all anymore, or only in the minds of men who remembered old tales.  If the system of tunnels existed we were going to explore it and reclaim it. The historian pointed out a golden seam, once the site of a handrail--"And down there," he said, pointing, "that's where the secret police had their headquarters, so you may not want to go there." Inside, something seemed strange--the tunnels were clean smelling, like a damp earth basement, and warmly lit, decorated with brightly colored furniture.  A young woman, a student at the local university, had discovered and reclaimed the tunnels, converting them into a boarding home of sorts.  "Utah Parrish" was her name--I realized that, as a child, I had wanted to be this woman, who was sort of a young adult Pippi Longstocking.  Inside the tunnels, networks of small colorfully painted rooms, tunnels kaliedoscoping in on each other, getting smaller and smaller, an infinite and shrinking maze, each possible passageway acknowledged with coats of bright paint, until the entranceways grew so small that only mice or bugs could get through.  One section only, dank concrete stairs leading to a heavy concrete door, lay dim.  "That's where the secret police put all the bodies--yuck," siad Utah.  The historian and others in the group were uncertain what to do with Utah, seeing as she had set up shop on public land--they settled on a warning.  4) The boy on trial for murder--he only eight or nine--running through the network of tunnels, knife in hand.  Was this real or just a convenient fiction created by his prosecutors?  His mom was convinced of his innocence--she had tattooed her belief on her arm--but he later confessed to her, sobbing.  5) The tunnel between North and South Korea, at first just a series of seemingly endless up and down metal staircases, winding around central shafts--always we met the North Korean army coming the opposite way, doing routine drills.  Our field trip continued.  We entered the fields of floating consumer goods, paddies of electronic items in one room, packaged snack foods in another--we had to hop from floating island to floating island to get across.   
4958 20060512092208 In a large room we were sitting at desks until a woman told us to get up and begin moving around, making a dance with our hands.  I was pretending to carry the weight of something heavy and round.  I would pretend that it was knowing me over and at the last minute I'd throw it up into the air.  Suddenly we were back in our seats and Doug Feltman was in front of my spot, slim like a little girl and now fashionable in skinny brown pants and an embossed belt, black hair plastered down on his skull almost like in high school but now it seemed cool because of his self-effacing, hesitant hip swaying.  He had come out a year ago and now what rdiated from him was not nervous energy but a calming feeling of comfortableness in his skin, even though his fashion-plate ensemble might suggest otherwise.  Doriet was telling me how she had asked the dance instructor about me and the teacher had said something about buying me coffee years ago. All this was taking place in the old Gramma's in Port Jefferson, or perhaps instead in the old comic store, nnow a tae kwan do school.  We got up to dance again and this time, most of the class stayed sitting down, so that it was only Heather Giesa, Doriet, Doug, the teacher and me, moving around and creating space with our bodies.  We all felt a need to move.  Brandon, Emma, and others would come to a large party at our house.  In a tiny room that was at once off the music hallway in Mount Sinai High School and inside the auditorium, we were warming up for an orchestra concert and choral concert.  I had to sing in the choir at the last minute, so I was warming up.  I was singing constanants and someone said to sing vowels, so I was trying to do that but people around me were singing very out of tune and it was throwing me off.  "Who's missing?" asked Dr. C., and some people shouted out, "Jessica Haggerty stepped out and is not back yet."  Her desk was set apart from all the others, which were neatly lined up in rows.  "Ah, Lix," he siad, and I thought to myself, "Jessica Haggerty's full name is Elizabeth Jessica Haggerty."  Andrea Sohngen was getting married.  Suddenly we saw the bride, tiny like she had been on 5th grade, her hair pinned up in a white cap like a dairymaid's, her long black and white zebra-striped dress grazing the floor.  She walked through the doors which were like the ones closest to the stage in our high school auditorium.  Suddenly I felt embarrassed because I was wearing a white bride's gown myself.    I walked through the doors myself, past the heavy tall church doors where people -- Erika Johnson, Sam Callahan -- were already gathered for the wedding.  I saw in bright sunlight Krissy Toro standing also in white gown -- but she was a bridesmaid.  I went downt he hallway, where the school leased out space for various shops.  There were two thrift shops up here and I felt certain I could unearth something to wear. Then I could offer Andrea the dress I ahd been wearing.  But when I got tot he first shop it had only winter stuff in it.  The second was closed until 2:30, and the wedding started at 11 a.m.  Outside the shop there were boxes full of sorted dress clothes -- ball gowns and the like -- so I looked through those for a while.  Then I saw thtat the door was open, so I peeked inside.  Nothing I would be able to wear anyway, but I complimented the lady shopping who had found twelve cotton tops.  I went off to look for another shop, stopping to take a peek at the mall style map.  When I made one turn I would up almost outside, by the theme park style entrance on the backside of the school.  Bottle gourds were dangling from opatches of purple pole beans between outdoor patio tables in a brick-paved patio area.  I asked a quartet what time it was and they said "11:25".  I was late.  I ran through where they were filming an episode where a man would stand with other people with a fake badge.  I ran back towards the school.  The stairways were strange, with low alcoves and s,oping floors, and one set of stairs to go up, another to go down.    Back at the church, I snuck int he open back door to catch the end of the ceremony.  A woman was playing a cast iron pan with chicken wire spread over it.  A beautiful rattling sound cmae out of it, like breath. a group of children and men was circling around the bride on the stage / altar.  Joining hands, they made a chain across the stage, then into the audience, where they circled in two groups, one on either side of the church, before coming together, just barely touching hands.  Through it allt eh strange breathing sound of the rattle and a gentle hu mming moan that was so sweet I was crying.  Erika, a few people down, said "Well, that's the first time I've seen a ceremony like that."  To here black-hairded, bearded friend, sitting next to his lady friend and holding a baby, she said, "Well, I'm sorry you have to share me this afternoon, but you're cool anyway." 
4993 20060303093407 In the immense, darkened basement of the lady's house where I was walking around with Critch, who had slimmed down a lot and was now very clean-cut, we walked around talking and looking out for a baby box turtle that had gotten loose.  I thought I found it -- a tiny darkened patch of about 1.5", but when we turned on the lights it started growing bigger, almost inflating, until it was three feet long and we could see that it was a wily, dangerous baby alligator.  We were trying to jump away from it, the woman who owned the house included, but it kept chasing us.  FInally it was biting me and I woke up screaming.  At a lecture inside a church somewhere in England.  It has been organized by some people from Amsterdam (but really they are from "Scandanavia") who want to expose the demagougery of one of their most powerful politicians.  The entire cathedral is full of people, including an entire row all the way in the back of Untitled people, which I notice only when I walk out.  The speaker is saying some uncomfortable things, things that don't make sense in light of what I know is actually happening on the streets, for example.  The speech is more spooky because it seems as if the speaker is using code words to refer to eliminating sectors of the population.  At some point he even seems to be trying to rile the crowd up.  The speech is supposed to be set up so that people ask questions as the speaker goes along, and the answers are incorporated into the speech. But in reality the only questions that are asked "toe the party line", sort of a straight man set-up for the speaker's next launch of rhetoric. At one point the speaker points directly to a man sitting near the front (whcih is near where I'm sitting too), and, with a withering glance that indicates that this man will be disappeared when the purges of people unfavorable to the speaker's regime start taking place, say, "And the ROman Catholics.  Heh.  Just ask Aaron here."    So I raise my voice, addressing the speaker, and say, "What about the Roman Catholics then?" He says something in return that doesn't answer the question so I stand up and say it again very loudly.  He brushes my question aside so still standing I say, "I'll be in the back then at the end of this talk waiting for an answer."    When I wait at the back of the church I stand with the two sponsors of the event.  Programs are circulating with the names of all the people involved in getting this man to speak.  "Aaron", the person we were instructed to ask about the Roman Catholics, finds me in the back and, hurriedly -- as he knows he has to get out of there fast, though there really is no hope for him --he also doesn't want to implicate us -- lets us know: "the government is making special schools, is in fact transforming all the public schools, excluding all Roman Catholics and teaching a special, state-sponsored religion, and doing all of this with public money."  Later - driving endlessly.  Late for a university class ont he outskirts of town.  Baked beans and egg on a tortilla given to me by some waiter in a restaurant where I am with my folks.  Later -- the man with the rag shop near the orchard I rediscovered some dreams ago.  From another approach, that of a wilderness wood, the woods are covered with rags and items (blocks of wood, saved scraps of things that might be useful).  He is a pack rat and hoarder.  I want to go visit him to say hello.  I wlak through a cleared part of his woods where he has an rv camp.  I queeze an orange for him to make fresh orange juice.  I am self-coinscious continuing to walk because I no longer have any clothes on below the waist.    Later - warner parks area / ritzy area hike, but transformed with strange nearly vertical paths and covered walkways.  I have arrived an hour late for their hike.  When I get to the top to the info center from one window I can see the sea beyond.  I am convincing young college-age people to participate in  the next Untitled show.  At first I am embarrassed because I am dorky next to their cool and polished rich kids selves, but they are very gracious.  ej shows up.  Later in a room with a fireplace in the corner in front of a narrow hall I don't ever go down, the whole room decorated in 70s shag carpeting and harvest colors, I am talking with someone, a lady who is an amalgam of people I have known in the past (Nancy Moser and Joanne McGough and Amy Scott among them).  The talk turns to a bizarre movie she is watching, which turns on -- a man who is basically a serial killer, and who has a strange accomplice (who is shown testifying against this man at some later point of the movie) who has a clown puppet that freakishly mutates to suggest people's worst fears and secret wishes.  The puppet is made on his hand, and seems to change automatically, without him having to adjust anything.  It is very scary and strange and I am shielding my eyes and blocking my ears because I don't want to watch it.  
4997 20060123111808 Someone outside the house in the rain.  I knew they were trying to attempt soemthing bad.  Sam Callahan left the house safely, but when we walked Wisty Pender out, Ruth's house next door was lit up by lights.  Kids were having a party in her garage and her house. Where was she?  Older, sketchy men from the party were trying to kidnap me, but Wisty and I were trying to distract them while Rick went to get help.  Great hills of sand separated bathers from the wild sea but that's how they liked it.  I walked along the ridges at the top of the dunes and could just barely glimpse the ocean on the other side.  I wasn't staying to sunbathe or take a dip, however; Ihad to walk back to my home, many miles.  For a while others (my mother, some friends?) walked with me. We saw many people below, sunbathing, including Mrs. Blumenthal, the old middle school health teacher.  Michelle V. (now that I cnanot remember her name it will plague me) yelled out at her, excited to see her there.    I finally told my companions to go on ahead.  I would follow behind and get there a little later, but eventually.  I was dragging a large picnic table and something else, perhaps a shelving system.  I was walking by all the abandoned mansions I used to love to play in when I was small.  Somewhere along this ridge hadbeen a secret compound and I searched for it with my eyes, trying to figure out which one it had been.  Chuck and Nan building an addition onto their house to rent out. Someone was giving tours of the strange abandoned mansions. I saw in my mond that same foundation and partially decayed house I had returned to again and again in dreams.  The outside was covered in vines and a thick low concrete wall ran around all of it.  Inside it seemed like the jungle.  It was perched on a cliff and beyond was the sea.  In or watching a movie of a school dance.  The most popular boy was grabbing the girl he liked and swinging her around.  He wrapped a long purple cape around her because she was embarrased that he was groping her in public.  He kept holding her high up like they were performing a cheerleading routine.  Back in the locker room the girl's teammates were examining her.  "Poor thing," they said, "you have a stiff neckfrom looking down in terror so much."  There were fifty teammates int he locker room.  They all decided to take a trip.  On the bus the shy boy who liked the girl was watching from the kitchen. We were all watching a video on an old VCR player.  It was a documentary of one guy's tour through the South in search of his father / father figure.  It began with a dusty car or bus rolling through the main square of a southern town.  We were in that vehicle ourselves.  "How is it that he is still known as the father of rock and roll?" came the disembodied, high-pitched boy's voice from the tape.  A gravelly, scratchy blues voice answered him back, "Because ... some people die, ten, eleven years ago.  People are still going to their graves, feel some sort of power coming from them.  Van Leer (?) die eighty years ago, people still going to his home, his grave, people still listening to him in the wind, because he is the father of it all."  We are driving know past the same scenes showing on the tape: in a median on the quiet road giant crocheted scarves, brightly colored, are hanging from a rack twenty feet tall.  We pull up to a yard and I remembere it -- we used to stop here for strawberries when we were young, and to see carved statues.  But soemthing is wrong because the yard is bare.  I see a "For Lease by Owner" sign, with phone number.  All the stuff has been moved, and there aren't even strawberries anymore.  But I had just been here a week ago, I think to myself.  Did the old man die?  Did they just move all his stuff, and him, to a new place?  Nothing remains of the statues carved out of wood, the little metal insects, the gods and goddesses in their appointed niches.  Someone has begun spraypainting on the stairwell, something that wouldn't have happened before.  We are walking back out to the car and one of the ladies with us is talking about some other guy whose work whe likes more -- "he really looks a thte trees, and replicated them in his own pieces", she says.  I am looking over the hills to where the trees are burning with a bright green though it is an indeterminate season.  In the car, we are speeding off to our next location, after I lift my leg, whcih has grown so heavy I cannot get it in the car without help.  We pass a Korean restaurant I have eaten at in another dream.  There are many Korean shops here.    In a bar people practiced their comedy routines.  It was dark and cold inside the bar and people were adjusting the lamps and heat lamps.  One man at our table did not want the heat lamp on but Hilda Fehd had pointed it to her and kept it on.  The land we were in felt right onthe edge of something; if we would keep driving we would get somewhere new, some undiscovered country. 
5164 20030824031608 to steal a portion of the day   (8/20)   Sis Sass had wanted to get to a gym and so I was leading her to it through cobblestone streets, closely walled by old houses.  And yet the ragtag bunch tailing at our feet shifted into a pack of would-be tourist revolutionaries who I needed to take to an activist meeting.  We marched up the wooden steps to the second floor loft; already there were over sixty people gathered--some standing, soem sitting on the floor.  I realized I'd left some people behind in the street and so I ran out to find them.  I half-dragged half-pushed them up the stairs--we were late, and if there was one thing activists couldn't tolerate, I'd learned, it was lack of punctuality.    I left my tourists in a corner and sat down near some people I'd seen before but didn't know well.  We were beginning a "get-to-know-you" exercise, but I'd missed the instructions so I looked closely at what they were doing to get the general idea.  They had divided a sheet of paper into three columns and made ten numbered boxes that spanned the three columns.  We were listening to a cd called "Sleepy Mother Teresa" or "Mother Sleepy Teresa"--a combination folk, hip-hop and blues album.  The girl on the cover looked like the little girl from Elvis Costello's video for "Veronica".    For each song, we had to identify the historical incident upon which the lyrics were based.  Then we had to identify the timeframe in which that incident occurred, and the geographical neighborhood or region in whcih it had taken place.    We finished up one about the Vietnam War which I was completely unable to identify...then we launched into one about mob control of New York City in the early 80s.  I still needed to do my history homework--I hadn't done it all semester, and now I was going to have to read the whole book to catch up.   that unspeaking daughter   (8/21)  I was driving someone to a lecture and I turned off Wedgewood/Blakemore onto the road of the "Capers" parking lot on Vanderbilt's campus.  "Well, here's your stop," I said to the person who rode with me, realizing only at that moment how awkward it was to be looking at him.    I was telling my friend Marcela who, of my former students, needed to be taken out of special ed.  Jessica Rodriguez needed to go, for one--I was making fun of her perpetual pre-adolescent whine, but I was very proud of the progress she had made, nonetheless.  Brittany, too, had passed her TAKS tests and needed to move on to regular classes.  I was asking Mrs. Garcia, the assistant principal, about Brittany's scores (Mrs. Garcia had a scheduling sheet that should have listed Brittany's scores, but for some reason it instead listed my name for all these proctoring responsibilities that I couldn't fill, no longer working at the school).    Marcela knew of a tragedy, hidden deep within the secret walls of the room where we stood.  If you tore off boards and crawled through the hole you made thus int he wall, you would get to two small storage rooms, about ten foot by ten foot and six feet high each.  Each was full of splintered wood, parts of old machines, boxes of rags and junk.  Beyond these two secret rooms, in a tiny crevice where they both joined together, a long tunnel led back futher into the darkness.  Back here there were the mouldering bones of a family a very small child had murdered with his bare hands.  I saw before me the hands of the small killer: they were enormous hands, grotesque.  The bones rested there, in the dirt and the darkness, strangely at peace; they let off a strange glow.  They were so far back in the earth that they seemed to be returning to stone and lava, rejoining the slow geologic processes at the center of the earth.  I had made my way into the first two secret rooms while my sister Kate had looked for me.  Now her voice, and my mom's, called at the cracks in the wall, frantic.  They peeked in through chinks in the wood; I had moved to the second, further-in room, where it was harder to glimpse me.  They put their eyes up to a slit in the shared wall.  "Boo," I said, sidling up to it.    My mom reprimanded me for trying to disturb what should lie sleeping.  The walls of the secret room had turned into towering cases for type.   ask not what end the gods have set out for thee (8/22) On the interminable line for the public restroom, I began talking with the woman next to me, resplendent in her long bleached hair.  Finally we got to the stalls--with my bare feet I had to step on the floor, disgusting, uncleaned and caked with urine.  I looked down in the stall to find a little girl.  I called out to her mother in the next stall.  "Can she go to the bathroom by herself?" I asked.    "She's eighteen months old--she doesn't even like to breast feed anymore," the mother replied, as though that were answer.  "See what you can do with her."    Outside, walking through a residential neighborhood, I turned the corner and found myself with a pet squirrel on a string.  No sooner had I noticed it than enormous magpies swooped down from the sky and began attacking it.  The more I tried to run them off, the more appeared.   
5190 20060213085807 Granny's house.  Some young guy laughing at photos of me in historical dress when I was small.  Outside on the balcony was a bottle of mayonnaise with a tiny bit left at the bottom -- I needed to use it for a salad.  We were leaving the house in the campgrounds in the dead of night.  This was partially because my sister couldn't live with Andy anymore, partially because of civil rights era style threats we had received to our safety.  We gathered up as much as we could, mostly bedding and some clothes, and waited for our ride, my mom's old professor Steve Barbash in an old silver Tourismo.  We were taking another car, too -- Sarah was driving this one, but we needed the other one to fit our stuff and also to accommodate Mom and Nanny.  Driving through the dark, woods and brnaches scratching the side of our car.  Then Rick and I realized that we had left his sleeping bags rolled up next to the stripped-off beds.  It was daylight and we were on the other side of the campground, on a strip of beach like the Jersey shore. I had the car stopped and got out, saying I would pick up what was needed.  It had changed to the "water wing", which I had never seen before.  My mom and Sarah told me that it would be in the kiddie play area.  There I saw it, among kids playing in fountains and pools.  There was a gauze net that could be filled with water and put on your back to elevate you.  It was attached to a hose.  The attendent turned around and asked, "Is that yours?"    "Yes," I said.  "It will need to be disinfected and the destroyed," she said.  "What if I just take it away?" I asked.    "It's been here unattended over fifteen minutes so it needs to be destroyed," she said.  I started wrapping the hose around my arms like I was wrapping extension cords.  The attendent was giving me looks and asking me to put it down but I acted like I didn't hear her and I was wrapping it up in this way to easier bring it to the disposal unit.  Then when the wing was almost ready to be wrapped up, and the attendent was distracted by another child, I ran off through the crowd and hid myself among the throng.  A ferry was just about to leave -- I ran through a crowd of beautiful girl gangsters, playing volleyball in their gang colors while their boyfriends watched on the sidelines.  I ran for a while in one direction, toward the camp where the cabin (actually Victorian-style summer home) was, then in the other direction, past the lady attendent, the ferry port, the gang playing volleyball, to where the strip of land with water on both sides joined the rest of the city, which I realized was like Manhattan, but human in scale.    I was running through the shops full of cheap imitation gold jewelery, earrings the size of doorknockers and blue bandannas, looking for the car that would be coming back to pick me up.  When I had run toward the cabins I ws afraid I might have missed it.  I looked around the corner of one shop and there was Rick with his hair down, very wavy.  He was coming up through an older part of the neighborhood which overlooked a spacious park.  I ran to meet him and we got in a white van. But first the car was the Malibu and we were sitting in front of Andy and Sarah's old place, trying to remember which house was which.  I figured it out -- amaryllis and lily of the valley growing in pots on top of the shelf in the screened off front porch -- a touch of my sister Sarah's.  Andy was on the phone, not yet realizing thatwe had left.  I wanted us to drive away before he saw us and we had to make up some excuse for why we were there, why Sarah wasn't, etc.  But Rick stayed a little longer and Andy saw us and came over.  Rick and Andy talked for a while -- I read music in the back seat, pretending to be half asleep.    Then Andy left after talking with me for a moment and Rick and I drove through a wooded path directly to our right.  Rick was driving through the rush hour traffic of the park on the edge of the beach strip where we had met up earlier.  We were driving up narrow paths lined with rocks and at one point came to the top of one, where there was a wrought iron gate with only one side open.  I tried opening the other side but there was a pole in themiddle.  We tried driving through but we had to drive onto the lawn and once we got past the gate the road was a dead end anyway.    We got out of the van because we realized we had to walk.  The road was now paved with rocks up-ended as though it might be a drainage path. The path sloped down steeply, at more than a sixty degree angle.  I had to try very hard to keep from falling.  I could barely look up from where I placed my hands I was so scared.  Finally I forced myself to look up. Before me the beautiful rooftops of the city, each neighborhood a different concentration of colors, green in the west, red in the east, yellow to the south.  Then, just before I woke my head told me, here is the information you requested: One must find one bright light like Virgil or Beatrice to be your guide through the dark wood and the winding stair.  One visible emanation of the One.  I tried falling back asleep to find out more but I could not return.  
5237 20060416172408 I heard a bolt of lightning and the heavy drops of rain and went outside.  There was Sarah swinging on a high swing among the bridal bush and russian olive and euonymus grove.  The swing was just a thick slab of wood attached by two ropes to the branch of a dead tree, over five feet off the ground.  How did she get up there? I wondered.  Her back was still broken and I was almost paralyzed with worry that she would fall and hurt herself or die, like the lady in the Secret Garden.  I went inside to find my mom to tell her but she was mad because she thought I did nothing but sleep all the time, and because I hadn't put away any of my clothes.  I was so hungry that I decided to just microwave a sausage.  I almost bit into it raw and then realized that was disgusting (it was disgusting anyway because in my dream I didn't eat meat either).  I put it in the microwave for a minute but that didn't seem long enough.  So I put it in for another minute and could see it getting pockmarked and pitted as it seemingly collapsed from the inside.  Then I was wandering around the old manor house.  Parts had been redone and blocked off but it was very old.  We weren't even in North America, even -- maybe we were in England.  The spot had been continuously occupied with permanent houses for a very long time.  "Mom is angry with you," Kate said as I walked toward the door.  "I know, and I don't care," I was saying as I walked on the landing, a narrow strip of walkway that you used to get to one of the two staircases that flanked the house at either end the door.  As I spoke, the door on the front of the house, never used and almost a facade, swung open.  A man stood behind it, with cocoa colored skin and a large afro, very contemporary looking, and a grey suit.  He said that the key had reappeared, and he handed me a small door key as though to prove his point, though that explained nothing.  Now it was no longer me that followed him outside, but a younger early twenties girl with long auburn hair and pale skin; she was very little.  She followed him down the steps and into one of numerous courtyards.  There were trees and shrubs planted all about the grounds, making screens and alleyways.  They sat down on a bench together and he made it clear to her that they should hook up, and quickly.  So she climbed on his lap and they started kissing but an auburn-haired dog with intelligent eyes -- like a border collie and austalian shepherd mix, but with long hair -- bounded up to them.  "Ahh, the grey zander," the man said.  He montions for the girl to follow him -- they can't stay so close to the house now, for whatever they do must involve the dog.    the girl goes back to the house. she is me and not me.  she is running through the house trying to gather some belongings to run away.  kate sees her again.  "mom's mad at you," she says but the girl jsut darts away and hides.  she escapes down the seldom-used eastern staircase.  the girl is just going to lay with the dog and the man in an allee of trees with a culvert flowing between them but it is too close to the house and they will be discovered.  So they are about to take off downthe culvert to where the trees grow thicker when suddenly there is shouting and screaming from the house.  the girl is no longer with either the man or dog and smoke is pouring out among the chairs and bodies of the people seated in the auditorium.  "And what about the chemo-skins?" my mom is asking about the students who have been undergoing cancer treatment or whose skins are chemically sensitive. They stand around with IVs, heads shaved, with their skins horribly burning and blistering because of the heat and smoke.  We look to the horizon where there are the low-lying rolling clouds of a massive fire. at first i think it is a nuclear explosion, but hten i look back to the auditorium and realize that there is adragon inside the building writhing and breathing fire.  it is most like an enormous serpent with a fierce eye and a bucking movement for locomotion, a movement that destroys most things in its path.    suddenly we see the man in armor appear.  "welcome to my thane", he says.  i realize that this was the legend of the grey zander: the dragon is a good-looking man at day, an evil dragon at night; while the true prince is a red dog during the day, and a king at night.  and they must always battle at night.  the dragon was once the man's retainer, turned bad, who put an evil spell upon the prince, that he could not regain his form unless he had a woman's love given freely to him (which has happened this afternoon, whether or nothe is victorious against the dragon).  it is unclear whether the bad retainer was magiced into a dragon or whether that was just his true nature emerging each night.  but we are never to see the fight scenep, or whether one or the other is victorious.  for the gathering inthe auditorium turns into an audience watching and participating in a documentary about making the movie version of this story.  i am finally hanging up my clothes -- pinneys of velvet and satin, saddle covers for horses, relics of jousting tournaments -- on a balcony that overlooks the theater and the open air paths below. 
5309 20060701110008 stairway lined with glass daggers, each step is the face of some famous individual, mostly male scientists but some philosophers, statesmen. there is another stairway almost directly across the room to my right and i wonder why i did not climb that one -- unlike this one, which climbs at an almost vertical angle to the top of the room (so that you must hoist yourself up to the next platform using two hands, all the while avoiding the shards of glass on either end, slipping on the shiny metal of the stair platforms, falling off or in between the steps, which are connected only by this low edging of shards of glass).  i am more and more fearful as i climb the stairs -- there's no banister, i'm constantly afraid i'll fall off -- until i reach about two-thirds of the way up.  the stairway slopes less abruptly here; the platforms of the steps are not theselves pitched, so that you must hold on tothem on all fours and reach for the next step from a kneeling position.  i can even read the biographical facts about some of the famous males.  i am hoisting myself over ethicists and physicists and when i finally reach the top i must give one last heroic pull to bridge the gap betweent he top of the stairs and the threshold of a long hallway.   inside the hallway, a man with chapbook on top of the stairs, one book with many revisions -- he has all the original pages, then revisions with cross-outs and additions, including "Fr. Frank Sinatra, Chinese Clown".  the pages are pink and blue.  the poems are confessional.  i see another lady, a girl really, penelope, calliope or penny (she is like anne of green gables and penny from inspector gadget in one).  she is a great poet and i am following her through the night in half-built suburban developments. the other man is chasing us, not in a scary way, just because he feels left out by us.  playing my viola at some school function -- i am trying to find the right doors to got through.  first i am in a large subterrenean buildign owned by rusty and kim.  they are trying to make sure i will be on time for the event.  i am still trying to prepare the music.  it is night downt here but when i get to the shcool it is day.  i am talkign with some people in the orchestra but suddenly realize that mr. feinberg is leading them in a piece of music.  i hurry off stage.  downstairs i relaize that there is a back entrance tothe stage but i also realize i am missing a piece of my music.  supposedly i had been playing it in the subterrenean place so it is either thee or lost soemwhere on the way.  i have to try to figure out what to do -- this part is never resolved. ari kramer's bass fine-tuners are stuck on a piece of carpeting.  his dad is finally able to get them free.  laura sobik's mom and dad and brother are in town to see this performance or some sort of religious ritual.  laura is in town too, but not having planned to meet up with her parents.  back at my parents' house i am changing out of my clothes.  i have a fun dress fromt eh early seventies that i am gathering up and transforming into a dress from the 1870s or even earlier.  mrs. sobik is talking about their low-carb diet.  outside i see jack the cat high in the treetops.  he is leaping across a wide space of air onto another branch.  finally i realize he is chasing a flying squirrel.  i also see, thoguh, that a man outside is partially responsible for getting him up the tree and enticed by the squirrel.  the man is part of a big group of hikers.  i go outside and chastise him.  at first i am saying things to him as i walk across the lawn but finally i just resort to making monkey noises.  i tell him he is like the tail-pulling baboon (except at first i say he's like the baboon pulling the tail of the chimpanzee,w hich doesn't make sense.) he doesn't really care.  more hikers come out of the woods.    inside we've gotten the cat down fromt eh tree but it looks likethe squirrel is dead -- not from the cat but from asphixyating under a washcloth when it tried to attack another cat.  in a futuristic world -- we are dropped off by bus in a deserted townt he bus driver doesn't even want to take us to, though we insist we must be brought there.  no one here can die; it is a type of hell, a penal colony whose residents have been transformed into sorts of cyborg.  we go into one building and suddenly there is a young man, between twenty and twenty-five, who first threatens us, but then realizes he can donothing to hurt us.  "the laws of death and harm don't work here," we say, and he breaks down weeping, asking us just to try to harm him.  we take knives and cut away at the back of his head.  at first nothing, but then swaths of hair and scalp begin to disappear.  he is crying because this means he can be liberated by us.  his friend appears and begs for the same, actually stands in the path of the night so that they are almost going to fight over who can be cut.  suddenly there is an announcement -- both official and a word-of-outh, warning cry -- the chief inspector, the ruler of this penal colony and indeed the whole political system of the new celestial government this futuristic world is part of -- is coming through for an inspection.  everyone runs and we must run too.  the inspector is somewhat like darth vader. 
5354 20030603183208 the dream vacation, reader's digest condensed version    dream of 5/30    I told a kid, Mrs. Roble's son Michael, that I'd race him up a steep curvy hill and to the corner.  We started running.  I gave him a head start and he pulled out ahead of me, tearing off the elevated sidewalk, almost seven feet off the road, and into the culvert that ran alongside the twisting road.  The whole point of racing had been to keep him occupied and safe, so I struggled to pull him up as he ran.  Just before the crest of the hill, I glimpsed an enormous snake, the size of an anaconda but slender, black yellow red.  It lay in the dappled shade of the lane at the top of the hill.  I couldn't determine whether it was poisonous.  I pointed it out to Michael but he couldn't see it, or for that matter, see me.  He was nearing the end of our course.  I decided to challenge him, right at the end, by zooming ahead of me.  It took all my effort.  My breath was coming in short sharp gasps, and my legs felt like they were made of wood or hardened clay.  A young girl, about four or five, was running, her long curly hair tangling in the breeze.  She was trying to dart across the road that stretched out like Highway 83 in the western Valley, brilliant and wavy in the heat, pursuing the sky and the end of the endless barren land.  The girl reached the other side of the road, where chain link fences partioned grassless tracts.  The girl kept darting along the fenced-off properties.  I grabbed her, first by the hand and then, lifting her up and throwing her over my shoulder, by her waist.  I walked her across the road to where her family had been watching, silent.  We were about to have a party.  I was bringing down snacks from our upstairs room, a single wall-less dance hall, illuminated as though in wax or amber by a single bare bulb.  The walls were lime green.  The vacation Bible school was preparing for a musical revue.  They were filming their preparations for a documentary on t.v.  All the girls--for there were only girls--were dancing to "The Brady Bunch".  Arie had gotten my Nanny a birthday card, and since I had forgotten to get her one myself, I was writing in it too.  But my handwriting was atrocious and I was writing something unitelligible in Russian.   dream of 5/31    I was walking with Bryce along the resaca/lake.  I was taking off my funny high shoes, the ones I haven't been able to find, with the tan leather flowers and the fake wood platforms.  At one point before I bent down to take them off, the lake water swirled dark and murky over my foot, yet I could still see the stones, smooth and polished like beach rock, gleaming white and tan below my feet.    Two women were talking about the meanings of the mosaic tiles embedded among the roots of the water-loving trees which shaded a section of our walk along the wall.  I glimpsed two names among the patterns laid like flat headstones among the roots, and suddenly I felt full of a love for someone I never could be with.  It hit me not like a pain but a slow and joyful realization, like honey poured in my veins.  The wall had emerged into sunlight again, and it was about to turn off sharply.  Suddenly--as a tan middle-aged white man in straw hat, boots and white shorts approached us--I realized that we had come to the point where the stone wall became the high and treacherous retaining wall for a masive dam.  It was thin and narrow here, despite its great height.    I knew without looking that beyond the sheer dropoff of the dam stretched a vast white plain of dried salt, glistening like snow or the desert in the sun.  The man was telling us not to walk there, but we'd already decided not to.  He was telling us about the history of the resaca, and the plains of salt, but I wasn't really listening.  I was thinking how the wall of the dam, strangely, let shining drops of water through to fall like silver to a deep pit beneath the salt plain.     dream of 6/1, or, enjoy your vacation   A man walking to his execution, during medieval times, although it simultaneously was today, at the site of my parents' neighbors' house.  First a woodblock picture; the man walking accompanied by guards and onlookers, the ax that would chop off his head held in his own hands.  Then the picture itself alive and in color, the man himself standing around trying to convince people not to kill him.  There were signs and portents, winds and calls.  But the strangest sight of all came after he had been killed, his head chopped off by the large battleaxe he'd wielded himself.    The sky was apocolyptic--sepia fire and gold, all the colors of volcanoes and Hephastean furnaces, the time of pterodactyls and of the formation of the earth.  The landscape rose sharply into towering mesas, mountains and vast plains.  The sky was a tower of clouds.  One of the clouds, as tall as the sky and full of smoky light, split open a single slit a third of the way up, shuttered open like a camera lens or a mail slot.  A section of beard appeared, illuminated by a clearer and more pure light.  Then the entire cloud rent itself, and behind it, angry and dark, appeared the terrible face, spoke the terrible voice of an awful and fearsome Old Testament God.    "I have given you signs and portents," God said.  "Now I will give you punishment."  Then I woke up. 
5403 20060203094207 Rick and I were staying in a trailer in a field, perhaps somewhere in Wales.  The day was summer-light but there were dark clouds like storm gathering on the east horizon and I wondered if I should close the side of the trailer which was completely open to the elements.  The trailer was silver and shaped like an egg.  Walking by the trailer came my old friend Rebecca Nesvet.  She walked up to the trailer and then walked away suddenly, in her awkward way, as though pretending that she had mistaken me for someone else.  "Well, hello, Rebecca," I said.  "Oh, Ali!  What a surprise -- I thought you were someone else" -- she was floundering awkwardly here, and I could tell she was somewhat disconcerted by Rick laying sleeping there as well.  I explained that I myslef was going to build a camera obscura and wondered if she had ever been to the one in Aberystwyth.  I was staying with Sam Callahan.  Later that evening we were going to go out for her birthday.  She had given me a chart that clasified everyone's ear wax, and assigned you a constellation and an earstrological group based on the chemical composition of your earwax, whcih it was possible to determine by taste and other observable properties.    In the meantime, I was looking through her large downstairs, all one room.  In the middle, free-standing, her bathroom vanity and sink were lit up.  I went over and was smelling different incense sticks.  But they turned out to be not incense but lip pencils, and I accidentally broke off one, and in fact, completely chewedit up (it had a sweet, candy-like taste reminscent of wax lips bubble gum). Then I was incredibly embarassed for having destroyed Sam's lip pencil. I tried sharpening it (it was shaped somewhat like an outdoor flame starter).  Beneath the lip pencil it was a tube of toothpaste.  When Sam returned she was okay with it.  SHe wanted me to pick a ribbon to wear in honor of her birthday (I picked out a peach one), but she wanted to go soon.  I asked if we had ten minutes for me to get ready.  We were outside in the night.  My new acquaintance Emily was telling me and others about how she had gotten in a fight on behalf of her husband at the Plowhaus, and how she had mistakenly thought she could bring one of her "sand paintings" to put up at the bar.  Still daylight now, but at dusk.  Walking through open fields with my unknown companion (still Sam?) at my side, we see a small dog trying to wrestle a stick away from a bull.  Walking further we see a bulldog trying to do the same with another bull, and then, more strangely, we see the bulls distroted slightly, with lichen on their hides and long, lean legs and cavernous bodies.  We are wlaking in a different direction now.  There are bulls who have two trees growing out of their heads where their horns would be, and Iunderstand this to have happened because a seed fell in a crevice near htir horns and was allowed to grow.  These trees are twenty feet tall so these animals are enormous.  Suddenly, in this smae field a little further down, enormous elephants, hundreds of years old, were racing around.  They had incredibly long legs, probably thirty or forty feet tall and they too had become part tree, but only because they seemed part bark.  I didn't know if it was safe to be walking (or running, because we were, out of fear of them running into or stampeding us) around them.  But a giant man, himself with long legs and arms, and a blue turban and a long, long stick that was curved at the end like a buddhist trumpet horn or a pipe, appeared on one of the elephants.  When we shouted up to ask him it it was okay for us to go through here he said it was , and he swung his horn over the ground to keep the path clear for us.  The elephants would not go where he swung his pipe.   We came to the edge of the field and to a woods thick with winter trees and brush.  There was a path through the woods and so we walked down it, the man, smaller now, walking with us.  To our left through the bare brush I could see two blue vats, each probably about ten feet tall, and a blue pool, of the blue not really ever found in nature.  I realized that it was a giant indigo dye vat.  Walking further we saw that the trail continued, all blue from seeping dye.  Further on we could see that there was a road accessible to cars (for we saw a car up there), but the woods grew thicker and the trail curved so that it was hard to see where it went next.  I wanted to go on but our guide and the people I was with said we had to go back.  So I decided I would go back on my own later on.  On my way back I stopped to pick up some of the blue liquid, whcih was dye, I decided, and some of the blue colored soil, which I put in my mouth and ate.  On a rock as we left the woods, words painted on int he blue dye, which none of us had seen before - "______ Sons, distributors of plant and naural dyes, Mumbai, Calcutta, Sri Lanka."    Walking back through the elephant field we arrived almost immediately in a giant covered market.  Vendors of Indian goods were everywhere.  Talking with Sam and Tiffany and Eric, we realized we had travelled back in time to get to this place.  Eric's company was destined to buy this structure and the magical field and woods, and then sell it.  Eric was moving abck to Washington D.C.  The trip back into the past had turned him back into a little kid.   
5479 20060416172807 I heard a bolt of lightning and the heavy drops of rain and went outside.  There was Sarah swinging on a high swing among the bridal bush and russian olive and euonymus grove.  The swing was just a thick slab of wood attached by two ropes to the branch of a dead tree, over five feet off the ground.  How did she get up there? I wondered.  Her back was still broken and I was almost paralyzed with worry that she would fall and hurt herself or die, like the lady in the Secret Garden.  I went inside to find my mom to tell her but she was mad because she thought I did nothing but sleep all the time, and because I hadn't put away any of my clothes.  I was so hungry that I decided to just microwave a sausage.  I almost bit into it raw and then realized that was disgusting (it was disgusting anyway because in my dream I didn't eat meat either).  I put it in the microwave for a minute but that didn't seem long enough.  So I put it in for another minute and could see it getting pockmarked and pitted as it seemingly collapsed from the inside.  Then I was wandering around the old manor house.  Parts had been redone and blocked off but it was very old.  We weren't even in North America, even -- maybe we were in England.

5506 20060828110210 Some land beyond where we live.  Water is trickling out of the earth in small streams that we cross on small bridges.  I go intot he back of our house to catch up with Les.  People are coming down through the woods.  I pass Jimmy Bradley on the way.  He's not supposed to be there.  I am in an old classroom that may be in a public schoolin Houston, or a college.  I am taking Ms. Coverdale's math test, though I haven't prepared at all.  Time is running out and everyone is leaving the classroom.  I keep calling Ms. Coverdale "Mrs. Siemers" and "Ms. Schippers" even though I know it's incorrect.  The questions require much more work than I am prepared for -- each question is like a mini project.  "Prepare the logo and promotional materialsfor a farmhouse bed and breakfast", reads the first question, "then calculate rates for various services.  Create a chart to give the tax rates for the following services ..."  A long list follows.  THat is just question one.  I am creating the work for the test - the work goes in liquor store size boxes that, stacked (or not, depending on the fragility of the work inside), just barely fit on a long 8 foot folding table.  It's lucky that we are all leaving for holidays so soon, I think to myslef, so that Ms. Coverdale can have a full roomto store the stuff she needs to grade.  I look over where Kiesha Graham is taking the exam.  She's covered some questions that I didn't even see, like "Calculate the amount of tax that should be applied to the oversized cheesesteak snadwich based on weight. Make a chart."  I ask MS. Coverdale, callingher by the wrong name again, if I can go finish the exam elsewhere since class is ending.  I've realized, shortly before this, that I've been missing math class -- not with Ms. Coverdale, but with Mr. Read, some class I need to graduate -- the whole semester, because it conflicted with my orchestra session.  I go to the cafeteria to finish my exam.  Laura Sobik is there too, and we sit at small round tables, just aobut the size for one, that are modern but rickety.  Doug Feltman, who materializes next to me at some point, has the capacity to turn invisible, in part or completely, at various points throughout the day.  Sometimes no one can find him because of this.    Marge and Homer waking up in the middle of the night intheir own bed fter returning from a long family trip.  "Something is wrong," Marge says.  They go through the rooms of the hosue.  Someone has ransacked the rooms.  It's unclear what's missing.  The man in the arcade looking over his screens full of secret camera footage.  He looks into the SImpson's home, laughing when he sees their distress.  There's footage of him reaching into a deep freeze.  "Ha, ha", he says when he reaches and grabs a box that reads "Marge's Cash". But when he opens it, horrible stinging insects come out and p[ursue and torment him.  Thefts are also taking place at a sidewalk sale by  I am trying to reach the police by phone.  The culprit is a cross between my student Michael de la Garza, Brian Consuelo, and Josh Cohen.  I am put on hold various times (though the hold is really just a man singing songs).  I am transferred to the woman who handles crime reports.  I accidentally hang upt he phone in commanding the culprit to sit down against the wall and not go outside to play with friends.  I get back ont he line only to hear the tail end of the woman's message telling me what to do.  I';m connected with a human somehow and I'm trying to explain what has happened: the culprit was stealing petty cash from the piles that were around, being managed poorly, as well as stealing hats and other such things.  I don't knwo the name of the school where we are at and I worry about how silly and disreputable I must seem.  Athena, in the guise of Winona Ryder, is standing on the street corner with flashing eyes.  My cousin Sam has recently taken up swordsmanship and is there with her long sword and a shorter dagger.  However it happens, suddenly Athena is mad and seeks to challenge Sam.  My feeling here is one of protectiveness and remorse.  I think there has been a misunderstanding -- Winona/Athena thinking that Sam, arrogantly, is challenging her or merely claiming to have the same power as the gods. Athena commands Sam to draw here sword and Sam, fumbling slightly, picks up her long sword and dagger.  She is mishandling the swords slightly and ends up drawing the sword up to Athena's face, which would never be done in stylized sword fighting.  Athena tells her to put down her swords and Sam doesso, slightly embarrassed.  Athena then takes out her long sword and a strange, three pronged dagger, like a trident almost, but with the prongs right next to one another.  Athena holds both sword and dagger together over Sam's head.  Then, with a single swift motion she makes as though she will scalp off Sam's knee-length,beautiful jet black hair.  Everyone holds their breath as the swords go gleaming through the air, the dagger scraping across the long sword silently.  We look at Sam: nothing seems harmed.  But to our side suddenly we see floating through air, soundlessly and swiftly dropping to the ground, a single tuft of Sam's bangs.    "Your bangs look pretty nice like that," I say, trying to lighten the mood, and there is a little canned laughter behind me.

5536 20060922074607 dream of 9/20: a small black spotted jaguar had moved into my house (or another's) and taken up with the small black housecat.  together they had made a black-haired child, small like its parents.  then a fire or a great storm came to the house and i had to grab the animals to keep them from the flood waters which rose and would sweep away the house.  i grabbed the jaguar dad but as we swam across the resaca he was actually next to me in the form of a golden dog, and it wa a small black puppy i carried and tried, fighting the current, to put on a log.  dream of 9/21: a woman had her dreams recorded, short snippets with funny itles.  i wanted to include mine where the content seemed to match her titles.  while i stayed with my parents my mom asked, since we would go into the city the next day, if i had called any of my friends.  i called danielle's number by heart and left a message.  when i sat with my mom at the downstairs couch and looked outside through the sliding glass door, i saw a deer.  but as i looked, the shape drew closer and i realized it was a fox.  i called it to me silently with my hand against the glass.  it bounded closer and closer and it was the size and shape of a long lean hungry wolf, but with fox eyes and tail.  i looked as another came bounding down.  we sat for a while with our eye locked, then they turned and went away.  one more came down and we looked at each other with my palm upon the glas. down the hill were coming a spotted palomino with its young colt, an exact tiny twin of it, by its side; and then another, this one more russet than the first.  my mom chastised me for placing my hand against the glass, callign the animals to me.  "don't you know its bad for them?" she asked.  i thought of the zoo where we look at animals through glass and see our own eyes reflected back.  the old cat had gotte a pink shirt someone put on it in jest stuck around its neck and now the shirt was choking it.  but hte cat would not allow anyone to come near it.  my mom was freaking out trying to catch it, but the cat, though old and bloated, kept skulking past.  "look at its tail!" my mom said.  because of lack of oxygen the tail was bristling up like a foxes'.  we chased the cataround the house and finally my mom let it outdoors inadvertanly.  i chased it to chuck's garagge, mirror-imaged in my dream.  i picked it up and it was making low growling noises at the back of its throat.  i was able to take off the shirt.  small welts were forming where the shirt had rubbed against skin.  i brought the cat inside and found the old jar of healing vetenarian salve.  i put it on and made a little tape bandage for the cat, so that he looked like miss moppet with her head in a duster (only with space for his eyes and nose and mouth).  he didn't like it but he couldn't get it off, or strangel himself with it inadvertantly, though it did fall behind his ears sometimes.  in the tv show which was like the power rangers the wide angle shot of the nursery playroom floor showed toys and games scattered haphazardly all across it, as you might see in real life.  kate was intriuged by the glow-in-the-dark wig and cap that the producers of the show had gotten for free by visiting a web page. earlier i saw the signs for an artists' group in another town.  they were having a show of glow-in-the-dark art and the entry fee was two dollars a piece.  they had a registration form wiht a long list of thiings you might be submitting: #1 was "a flat object represented in 20-D"; #37 was "I'll fold glow-in-the-dark origami, thanks".  back in the tv show, whose messy set, i realized, concealed a cleverly masked product placement method, we watched as our heroes escaped one quandry to return to their apartment home.  inside, they said hello to their life-size statue of elvis, failing to realize that an evil agent had taken his place.  eventually the stautue came tolife but for the oment it was their friend and troubadour, who first tackled the lone female of the show, then sat on a matress surrounded by the debris of the playroom and began playing his guitar.  but the guitar soon turned to duelign snakes that grappled with each other like a caduceus, first entwining with one another, then leaping out from a central point as though they would attack.  in my eyes the show substituted stylized violence for stylized sex and i told kate so, but she was much more interested int eh wig.  back upstairs my sister sarah and cousin samantha were still in my sisters' old bedroom.  when i got there though, sarah was up and had left and my cousin was trying to sleep inone of the three small beds in the room.  i checked the kempleton wiki despite my best intentions.  i opened up four tabs.  on the first page i opened, a page filled with alternating lines from many poems, someone had last written: "the two i love depart for new york city / the love of absence.  all honor to your mother."  i was looking for a pair of pants to ear to do yoga.  i found two pairs of grey courduroys in sarah's dresser.  then finally i found a pair of black pants.  i went into my parents new bedroom, a different and new part of the house, to put them on.  when i got out, a woman's shirt beeped incessantly as we gathered to go into a room and practice yoga.  the woman looked around bemusedly.  she had gotten the shirt, which was required wearing, for free, but now perhaps people thought she had stolen it, since it kept on beeping.  finally i woke up, realizing it was the alarm.   
5622 20030329161008 but if the hair should break   Wherever I went had the same dim overhead lighting, red-tinted as though filtered through cloth--or no light at all, except a scant and chipped-away moon.    In a dim large conference room, forty or fifty students were sitting--a mix of kids I went to high school with and students I had taught.  All were just under my age, it seemed--though I simultaneously saw my past students as little children.  The class was loud and unruly; I had no lesson plans.  Out of desperation I had told everyone that we would be cooking something together--chocolate coconut cherry clusters--but only those students that were paying attention and not wandering around would be able to cook.   The walls were made of red velvet drapery; the room was oppressive.  The students were sitting in tight rows.  We weren't going to cook that day--class was nearly over, and besides, I would have needed to have frozen ingredients to have them ready to mix.  I was dismissing groups of students in a fashion that seemed senseless--retaining those students who were still unruly, letting go the quiet meek docile students.    Rick and I were climbing across rocks like the ones piled by the harbor where I grew up--cleaved concrete flat on one side, jagged and secret on all others, piled on top and beside each other to make crevices and passageways and places unsafe to step.  We were in a walled and ceilinged cavern, a dark warehouse of a room, a passageway between two important points.  For some reason I had led my students here far earlier, too, on a dark night and without any other assistance.    "I'm sure there's a sinkhole here," Rick said, and I shone a flashlight, materialized mysteriously in my hand, down to the space where he was pointing.  There was a culvert pipe down there, in a dark passageway created by the rough edges of several rocks. As I looked more closely I saw that the passageway twisted and turned deep back into the rocks, and that more culvert pipes jutted out from it.    "But we won't go down there," Rick said, "because we can't be sure we can get out once we get into it."  We kept on scrambling over the rock, our hands gripping where our feet could not.  We were midway between the floor of the passageway and the ceiling.  Another group of travellers had entered the room and were trying to squeeze past us.  We were in a different section now, just a short distance from the rough-hewn rocks, but completely different in character. Large relics of an industiral age were piled on top of each other and upon loose massive rocks.  There were ancient water boilers, an industrial size coffee maker/engine, radiators in various states of disuse, rust and disrepair. Some, however, were still working, and I was trapped between a superhot water boiler and a leaden press or paper beater.    The group that had entered in after us was talking about the great age of the passageway we were crossing.  "Indians used this, long ago, to get from important place to important place quickly," said a middle-aged woman in touristy clothes.  "We, too, can still use it."  I looked above my head, where an ornate and beautifully carved wooden coffee table, just about three feet high and a foot-and--half across, was hanging like the sword of damocles above my head. It was suspended by fishing line.  Somehow I knew that it had been my maternal grandfather's mother's--"from the old country"--and that it was mine for the asking, if I asked for it after I had crossed the passageway.  But it followed me above my head as I moved with caution and trepidation past the old machines.   I was down on the ground and seeing before my eyes, superimposed on an old multi-paned window that looked out on dirt, the separate frames of an experimental cartoon by the guy who draws the "Boondocks" comics.  It was all simple blocks of color, loosely joined to make forms that receded and approached in the separate frames.  As I watched more closely, I saw that it was the story of a large woman who was about to give birth.  She had driven her husband out of the backyard, where she was squatting.  She looked like the back view of a polar bear on its haunches.  Suddenly she was submerged in a deep pool of water.  She went under and resurfaced: some distance frome her, about ten feet, a hand clasping a baby by one leg, so that it resembled a short Excalibur, emerged.  The baby stood upright, its eyes closed and its arms folded across its chest; it was a statue.  The hand and baby submerged again, then re-emerged.  The baby was alive.  The large woman held it in her arms, both of them dripping wet.  Then the large woman was thinner and at a witches' coven in a spring wood.    Hooded witches and warlocks were there, and were-wolves and were-beasts--but whether they were cruel fairytale creatures or just relics of a more magical time was hard to tell.  They were eating chicken-head kebobs and standing in a circle admiring the woman's children--two tiny identical gnome babies in matching suits, looking like wizened old-man newborns.    "Well, that gives us something to work for," said one of the witches. Beneath the depths of her white furry hooded cloak and lots of silver jewelery, she was beautiful and wise.  The woman with the gnome babies departed, and the coven continued munching on chicken-head kebobs.  A camera panned in on a giant were-wolf's face, long sharp teeth glinting invitingly. He had many silver chains around his neck, and a seventies-style shirt unbuttoned to show off his chest hair.  He was going to announce the next segment of the show.

5633 20030112105607 Dream I  Earlier--in another dream from which I woke up and cleared my head--my  sister Kate and I were arguing in her room at my parents' house over  what can only be described as a red watch plaid waistcoat.  We both claimed the other had stolen it.  Nothing was resolved, although it  almost came to blows.  Yet this didn't prevent us from continuing to  argue while we sat downstairs and ate mini M&Ms, watching as my mother  tore the room apart in a re-decorating frenzy.  (She had stripped down  all the slipcovering and paint and extra stuff of all the surface and  furniture, so that the normally cluttered and cozy downstairs looked  grand and bare.)  (At some point soon after the altercation--though this is peripheral to  the main thread of the dream--I was sitting on my own in a room that was  more like a cavern, one of several in a suite of rooms reserved for a  conference.  I was supposed to be operating a cash table, but I was  entranced instead by the odd drainage system of the room.  The walls  were leaking--in some cases, gushing--but all the water drained into a  three-inch wide culvert that ran at the bottom of all the walls, and  that ultimately drained into a not very well-concealed sewer at the back  of the room.  I wanted to hop in and explore, but remembering my duties  to the cash table, I did not.  On my way back I realized the sides of the room were littered with multicolored polished stones, some of them  seeming conglomerates of many different semi-precious gems, some rare  metals, all of them incredibly lustrous, all of them smooth and rounded  and slightly sedimentery looking, like the stones you find in a cave  stream.  I picked up a handfull and went back to the cash table.)  Dream II  This was later, after I'd gone back to sleep.  Everyone on my mom's side  of the family had gathered in a small beachtown resort for some major  holiday, but now everyone was getting ready to go.   Including, of all  people, my Pop-Pop who died this fall, who in my dream had had his  abilities to walk (lost since his stroke eight years ago) restored.   Now, it seemed, he was walking around tricked out like a Sandinista,  resplendent in black beret, a string of ammo across his chest, and a  strange set of knee-strapped knives.  I was waiting to see this for  myself, though--so far I hadn't caught a glimpse of him.  "We're twins," I said to my sister Kate as we tried on clothes in my  cousin Caitlin's room.  "No, we're not," she said as she swooshed out of  the room in a silk shirt, black pants and silk kimono, the exact same  thing I was wearing.   I was walking back to the main house with my other sister Sarah, passing through a dining area.  On a small menu board by the ordering area a  woman, Nikki, had scrawled a cryptic and disturbing message, but I  didn't get to read it.  At a table sat some teachers and students from  Landrum, the school I taught in in Texas.  My old student Jeli was  acting up--I went over to reprimand her and just stood there with a  stern look on my face.  She looked up at me, first surprised, then  distressed, then smiling--she held up her wrist with its tiny wristwatch  and said, "Time?  Time, Bellos, time?"  just as she had every day when I  went to pick her up in her general ed kindergarten class.  I burst out  crying in my dream (I think I may have been crying actually, too); I  kept saying to the people at the table, "I realize now that I have  actually left all of you and all of my students behind."  We were running late, Sarah and I, so we set off toward the main house again.   Low planes were flying overhead, and I realized I'd left a book back in  our cousin's room--The Satanic Verses--and for some reason there was a  poem in it I had to read again.  We set back to get it but realized we  were walking in the wrong direction, and in a strange dream-disturbance  of time and space, arrived at the main house faster than we expected.  Rick was in my cousin Caitlin's car, cleaning it out.  There was an old  warehouse-style brownstone standing next to the main resort house, its  faded bricks painted with the Springwater logo.  Apparently it was not  just a trendy knockoff, but an actual brewery.  "I drank that beer when  it first came out," said Rick, making a face.  "It wasn't much more than  spring water then."  Kate was standing outside on the large lawn, proclaiming that she needed  to ride with Caitlin in her car, that she certainly wasn't riding with  any of us.    "Horseshit, Kate.  That's horseshit," I said to her.  Then I told her  I'd fight with her right there if that's what she wanted, and threw a  drawing pencil at her.  I missed her, because my aim isn't that good in  dreams or real life, but the wad of gum she threw at me clipped my ear  and nearly stuck to my hair.  Then I remembered some sort of spiritual  training I'd taken that forbade me from striking or injuring another  person.  She was coming at me full force, like a linebacker.  Apparently  my spiritual training did not prevent me from pulling out the fu on  her...From somewhere in the depths of me I recalled some of my tae kwan  do training.  She kept hanging on to my blocks, though, so that at the  end we stood locked on the lawn, both of us unwilling to let go of the other.  I looked up.  My aunts and uncles and cousins were getting ready to go.   There was my grandpa, beret cocked authoritatively on his head, knives strapped at his knees, green uniform neatly pressed, eyes and mouth as bewildered and innocent as they had been this past summer as he lay in  his hospital bed just before he died.       
5656 20060424101207 -in the woods the abandoned house looked a lot like the blamey's house, but it was not.  i was telling the woman about the blamey's house; what i talked about was its layout.  "and the first room has a front made out of glass, glass panes and a glass door.  if you go in to the left almost imediately on either side you can walk up a narrow little staircase that connects with a wooden walkway to little rooms on either side.  these are the bedrooms and they are full of clothes torn out of closets by vandals and strewn across the room.  in one room the roof has caved in and the sky comes in though the hole in the ceiling.  downstairs there is a kitchen and another bedroom ..."  i did not really get to tell her about the side bedroom and the kitchen really because she was talking about how the abandoned house we were at now did not give her any spooky feelings -- not that she "was an expert at those things".  i continue, "there is also a garage, a big garage, and a playroom and a shed [but that isn't true so i don't know what i was thinking of] and a kennel and a pool."  -we thought we would get food at the greasy spoon new orleans style kitchen.  but the old man who was to seat us was strange, as was the layout of the restaurant, little more than a lunch counter.  to get anywhere you had to step over people sitting intheir padded chairs.  at some point i rested my hand on the old fashioned projector, which was hooked up to a little mac laptop.  i shut it accidentally and powered the old projector off.  the little man started panicking, trying to restart it.  "os mac heart?" he asked as the computer restarted and spoke itsoperating system aloud.  "no," i said, but i reopened the projector case and simply set the top loosely on the bottom so that it was slightly ajar.  a green light showed it was operational.  -my mom is walking on a narrow ledge, wooden, around a pit of architectural and archaelogical remains.  i am trying to pull her away. she and my dad are mad at each other.  earlier she and i have gone together to what is actually the same space, only looking different.  it is where we first dug down to revela the frame of a house or an inner temple building.  now we have built a roof and walls around it with cinder block but my mom wonders why we had to dig down first without the newly constructed walls -- couldn't we build those first she questions. i try to explain that we had to do the more vulnerable parts of the excavation first because some things would be mroe difficult or impossible once walls were up.  -dogs keep trying to eat my lunch, which i have gotten out of a dorm sized fridge in the middle of the marshes somewhere just outside of nyc. i am dining with friends and family there.  i try hitting the dogs ont he nose to get them to go away but they do not.  -if the young man could be back in a certain spot by 1:19 on 1/19 with a leading lady, he would get the role of his dreams and fulfill a prophecy.  i have completely forgotten that this search is what this whole movie (for the dream was filmed as a movie) was about.  but now we see the cameraman zoom in on his watch.  the time is 1:19.  the young man is nearly in tears, looking around in the subway staircase, overgrown with time and rust and age.  it is a hopeless case.  he will enver get to where he needs to be, let alone with the person who is supposed to accompany him to the casting call. but just then the man in the wheelchair, the director, appears.  "come on, come on," he says to the man, "you're it, you're the one."  -an ornate cathedral.  we look at the stained glass and heavy wood door, once side of which reads "mercy"; the other "service".  my companion, a lady, thinks that the writing is too high and i say that perhaps a race of giants settled here first.  this is connected to the young man in the casting call but also to an adventure on foreign city streets.  -sarah felt the urge to go look at what we used to call crack house #2, down by the water on shore road.  she wanted to see the old twig and log gazebo where we used to play.  but when she went down, we could see there was a sign: "no gate" (meaning no gate to the harbor).  i saw that they had put up a row of brick condos.  there's a woman in her 50s out there and i feel a little awkward for sarah but next i know she is at the front door of the gazebo, now a house, listening to a radio being played by a young rocker.  she likes this guy and tells me so as we walk to the harbor.  -the police car driving on water down by the harbor by mom and dad's.  i noticed that many cars were parked on the water.    -we are int he elementary back gym and i am putting away various pairs of earrings alison macholz's mom has received.  alison jaffe is also related to the macholzs now.  i feel awkward because i have actually opened a box of earrings without asking alison's mom.  i am putting them all on a strip of fabric as a sort of penance when i look out the window to see the black clouds gathering. we are in a college building.  i turn to my companion, who is supposed to be showing me some sort of math procedure, and we decide we must go downstairs to the basement.  but once we are down there (and after i've snuck a few more peeks at the swirling black clouds), i recall that i shave left my glasses and most of ms. macholz's jewelry up there.  so i run up to get it.  the tornado is already striking, or just about to, because i can here an incredibly loud noise like a train.  i gather up the stuff and run towards the basement again but now there is a very slow-moving line.  finally i get down there and the scare is over. 
5691 20060630095207 bus ride in the night with ryan becker, alex prater, others.  james wood the cellist is there too.  we have lots of instruments on the bus.  we stop finally before our destination -- it is a city bus but we are the only people on it.  the bus driver is waiting while we unload our things.  i think that it is kind of strange that he is waiting for us and has driven up to this stop that is not specifically marked ont he bus route.  people go inside and are yakking away.  but i remember that we have not paid our fares and that many of our things (including my viola and several other instruments) are still on the bus.  i go back out with someone else from inside, an old friend of ryan's.  as we go outside i ask how much is appropriate to give the driver.  i had been thinking $5 each, and i was going to pay for someone else -- my sister? or james wood? -- but the guy i'm walking with says $2.15 is enough.  i am still going to pay a bit more.  the guy feeds his money into a little bill / coin acceptor on the outside of the bus.  he goes in and grabs a few things but i see that my viola and james's instruments are now at the front of the bus.  later in the dream i realize that they have been moved there deliberately by the bus driver, who when i go up there to get them is sleeping (later i realize he is only pretending to be sleeping).  i bring the instruments to the back of the bus and go back to the front to get more.  the guy who accompanied me has taken the instruments from the  back of the bus and gone back to the house and when the door shuts suddenly i realize that the driver is awake and has deliberately locked the door.  at first i think he's angry because i haven't paid my fare but when i start to get my money out as he is starting the bus i realize that he is up to something more sinister.  he is going to drive me away soemwhere and i'm not sure if the intent is to rape or kill or kidnap me but the intentions are definitely not good.  i am trying to think fast and i decide the best thing that i can do is talk with him and try to make him "like me" to the degree that he will be more amenable to suggestions that i may make.  i also will myself in my dream to have a cell phone and i make myself in the dream be able to text message everyone in my phonebook the fact that i am being kidnapped and the number of the bus, 2128.  i wake up repeatedly fromt he dream at this point and at somepoint in real life try to stop dreaming it by washing my face and walking around for a while.  but the night and the bus ride through barren land at the outside of a city (i think it's new orleans or somewhere in louisiana for some reason) continue.  shopping with my mom before a trip somewhere -- i'm supposed to leave that afternoon and time keeps slipping away faster and faster.  i haven't packed yet and have no clothes to do so.  we are in a victoria's secret but it's some bargain basement section of it with racks and racks of discount shoes -- only most of the shoes are gone, aready purchased. my mom tries on one pair that is enormous.  i tell her they make her feet look like giant rats and we laugh becuase the do -- they are grey and felted and about two feet long and one feet high.  my mom finds one pair she likes and i, later, find another pair that i think are okay, for $19.99, but when i try them on (i have to shuffle shoes around to find the one i think matches, as they are no longer in boxes together), i realize that, though both are slip-on sneakers with no back, one is a platform shoe, the other has a tiny kitten heel.  in the woods behind my mom and dad's it's like a wonderland of beautiful trees and fallen brown leaves that are coppery and gold.  it is winter and the whole world is silver and copper.  perhaps i get ther by climbing trees with low looping brnaches soemwhere else.  there are all these springs and creeks that dip underground suddenly and i am tracing there paths.  for the first time i am seeing where all of these lead.  i can feel where the water runs underground and by looking at the lay of the land i can say where the stream that suddenly disappears underground reappears.  though i need to go in sot hat i can finish packing and leave i am climbing one last tree, sycamore white grey green bark, yellow-gold budding leaves coming out it; it's on its side and i'm climbing up around and through it.  then i am on my way hoe and i pass a pile of yellow snow -- at first i think maybe it's left by foxes but then i see my parents' house directly ahead, much closer than i had thought, and think maybe it's jack's spot to pee.  there are hosues just behind my parents', old lookign carriage house and out buildings, but they are not owned by my parents.  i never realized how close they were.  at bryce's - some sort of ceremony or gathering.  the garbage can holder outside actually filled with metal pizza pie boxes that hold some other exciting thing inside them.  this is not bryce's current house, but a house on a seemingly english street.  getting dressed.  i see andee rudloff and we are talking about just wearing towels.  in bryce's bathroom, someone has turned on the heat in the whole hosue but this means the heating unit is leaking boiling hot water on my head every now and then, in a rectangular pattern.  someone says that she knows kate (my sister) is rectangular, but how does that effect how she acts?  i am now very late for my flight -- i find sarah's travel info -- she's to leave at 5:35 p.m. on monday,but when am i supposed to go?  it's already thursday at 6:30.  heard in my head just before first waking up this morning: "self-defense is self-defense, not a crime"  
5699 20030820112207 fixing a hole where the rain can get in  dream of 8/18  Jenny Romer was in my parents' backyard.  Her face was beatific: she had acheived earthly nirvana and was walking around, her head illuminated by an amber halo.  I was happy to see her.  The Blameys' house next door, long since deserted and trashed, was glowing with electric light.  It was dusk, and the night fell more rapidly here among the close trees, the brambles and the ivy.  The glass-walled front room was ablaze with lights, and the floors had been swept bare, so that the whole house looked like a gallery space in between shows waiting to be filled.  It was so bright that my first impression was that ghosts were inside, that the spirits of the the dead Blameys had come back to life and back to their summer home for just one night, to restore for just one night the warmth and light that had filled t= he house when they lived there.  But actually some young people were inside, hiding out, as they put it, "from the social scene".  I ran into two men from South Asia, both Muslim, and promptly began, for no=  reason that I could discern, making fun of Irish Catholics and the followe= rs of Islam.  I sped off in a car with my sister Kate.  A network of highwa= ys faced us, all elevated and running in and out of each other like tangled=  systems of roots.  High above ground we drove on and off entrance and exit=  ramps.  On the far horizon as Rick showered I glimpsed a towering vertical cloud, moving rapidly up and down like a jig saw blade.  "A tornado," I thought, and ran to tell Rick.  Someone was talking disparagingly about "the Old 94's".  dream of 8/19  There was a concert downtown I was walking to but I wound up in someone's room instead, holding a big plastic bucket of beet juice.  Our friend Nick was supposed to show up, but he never did.  The guy whose bed I was sitting in looked at me very seriously and said, "And you like d that guy from Jump, Little Children, too, didn't you."  I didn't know who he was talking about, but I was sad that he would accuse me of liking someone else, and angry that he would presume to know my heart. =20  It was time for me to go home, and yet I couldn't, and didn't want to. There was a noise of shuffling feet and dragging furniture upstairs; then above our heads the ceiling started leaking, just above the left pillow.  The guy said something about the upstairs neighbors and futilely tried stopping the leak with his hands.  "You should sleep turned = the other way," I said to the guy, indicating the baseboard, which was two = feet high, mahaghony and teak, and almost as elaborately carved as the head= board.  My container of beet juice had spilled all over the comforter and s= heets.  I was trying to sop it up but drops of it had gotten over everthing= , even important papers and old letters.  "I am really sorry that I ruined = everything," I said to the guy, my friend, and I meant it.  Then I was driving along to an intersection with a major highway--for some reason I could cross, at that point, the four lanes of traffic from on= e direction, the median and the four lanes of traffic from the opposite dir= ection.  I was trying to get to my hotel across the highway, but when I fin= ally got to that side I realized the entrance was the wrong way some 100 ya= rdsdown the four lanes of oncoming traffic.  So I got on the highway, plann= ing to exit at the next chance I got. That chance was exit 24.  I got off, = following a pickup ruck.  Almost immeditely the tone of the scenery changed= .  I passed burned out shells of houses, decrepit husks of wooden shacks, b= ursting at the seams with rusted out machinery and tattered rags.  The road=  changed from paved highway to a one-lane narrow street and finally to dirt= .  The brambles on either side pulled in tight against the car.  I was stil= l following the pick-up close but I realized they were driving into a dead-= end turnaround.  Past a curve and the briars I could see the dirt road open=  up into what looked like a quarry or a giant strip mine.  The walls of a g= iant basin had been eaten away by machinery, the bones of which lay scatter= ed along the base of the man-made canyon.  Two men were getting out of the = pickup truck I had followed. =20  "Hey," I called after then.  "Excuse me?  Can you help-" They were walking inside a trailer shack.  "Could you tell-" I ran after the man that had turned and looked straight at me, then turned around without word and headed back into the shed. =20  "Please," I called to him, "can you help me get back to the highway?"  I was following him as he walked inside, past other dirty and grinning men with scraggly hair and greasy hands and workshirts too small for their big = bellies.  There were parts of machines, boxes and crates and tools and lumb= er everywhere, piled on the floor so that walking became a game of Twister.=  I was following him up partially put-in stairs.  There were dogs in cages = everywhere and I reached out to let one, an Irish setter, sniff my hand.  "You need to get over to the highway?" the man asked, and proceeded to give me directions so rapidly I could barely remember them to write them down.  I was in North Nashville, it seemed.  He told me about a restaurant I needed to try, the Alley Cat.  Then when I had gotten on my way and driven back through town--for he had me go that long way and not the shortcut he had taken, I glimpsed a beautiful firehouse, desecrated by vandals.  All the iron work on the building had been cut and broken off.  The facade had been spraypainted and all the windows busted out. "Born Wild" the motto above the firestation doors and windows read.  
6068 20030222104608 Don't Forget the Salt   We were in a big mall, Rick, his brother, his mother, and I.  I kept  finding rolls of unused postage stamps--beautiful postage stamps, some  worth only thirty-four cents but with three cent stamps on the roll next  to them.   The mall turned into my old elementary school.  I was walking the  hallways looking for a specific teacher; for some reason I need to talk  with her and get a ride home with her.  I stopped off in the classroom  of Ms. Wrba.    "Are you sad?" she asked.  "I know it's the anniversary of Ms.  Danielson's death."  Up until then I hadn't realized that Ms. Danielson  had died, but I suddenly was very sad.  (In my dream Ms. Danielson and  Ms. Donnelly, a teacher who had died when I was in the fifth grade, were  one and the same person.)  "I think her spirit still haunts this room," Ms. Wrba said.  Her room  wwas laid out very strangely.  It was very small, to begin with-- probably only about 20 feet by fifteen feet--and there were about three  rows of three desks lined up in the center right of the room.  There was  a dull kakhi burlap-like covering over all the walls, and the entire  left wall was covered with school-style impossible-to-open windows. Ms.  Wrba's desk sat off to the upper right of the room; a set of slim  closets jutted out from the left wall, creating an alcove in the upper  left of the room.      It was the front slim closet, Ms. Wrba thought, that was the spirit's  chief haunt.  "Go in and check it out, will you?" she asked me. I did.  I couldn't  really feel any ghostly presence, but I noticed that the closet itself  was unkempt and sometimes transmitted the noise and breeze of the  outside wind.  We talked some more, and Ms. Wrba explained that the teacher had come to see had been arrested and was on trial for  falisifying or failing to comply with government standards for bilingual  education back in the 70s. Something about her arrest smacked of ex post  facto, I thought to myself.  Ms. Wrba asked me to check out the closet  again.  I did; this time I could feel a presence.  It felt like a  tornado.    "We have to get out of here," I said, rapidly stepping out of the  closet.  "There's a tornado."  Ms. Wrba and I raced throught the  elementary school hallway.  It seemed like every room had a whole wall  of unsecured windows and nowhere to shelter oneself.  We could hear the  wind whipping through the halls and outside; it was shrill and grating,  bass low and whistle high in alternate takes.  Beams from the ceiling were falling down.  One man was trying to barricade a door with a fallen crossbeam.    "Quick, let's get to the basement," I said.  I'd remebered where it was.   We tried to convince one jolly looking consultant to come with us.  His  face looked grim for a second, then erased itself into a daft-looking smile.  "No, I'm just going to jet on home," he said.  "Shouldn't take more than  two minutes."  "You don't have two minutes," I said, and tried to pull him with us, but  he just stood there.  We made it to the basement.  Hundreds of people were huddled down there.   The floor was of earth, the walls of closely fit flat pieces of stone.   There was a section where water seeped out of the walls and pooled,  green and slimy, on the floor. I saw my Aunt Doreen and Uncle Joe and  realized that all of my family would be looking for me.  I started  looking for them.  In another dream, I was fooling around on a very old Macintosh.   Suddenly a game I had never seen before appeared.  It was a graphic  design program where you could make animated films.  There were  different segments of it that had funny, acronym based names, but the  only one I can remember now is "CLIGULA".  I wanted to view the  instructions, and when I clicked on them, a giant screen unfolded before  me.  I was watching the intro to "The Black Scarab" or "Scarab Rider" or  "The Black Scarab Rider" or some other ridiculous title-frame, all in animation, featuring a man in a turban riding a horse straight on  torwards me. Suddenly the movie was semi-live action, about a  mischevious and somewhat Don Juan-ish dwarf.  Suddenly Rick, Arie, and my childhood neighbor Brian Neil showed up in  the dwarf film.    "We're going to the library," they said, so I went with them.  They were  running over a long irrigation canal--it was a grassy strip of land  about twelve feet wide, surrounded by water on either side.  Something  had made the water, normally placid (as we were far inland), choppy and  disturbed.  I was getting dizzy; I had to start crawling on the ground.   I felt sick and woozy, as though I might fall into the water accidently  (the water was at the same level as the ground where we were running,  now, and the irrigation canal looked like the bridge over Lake Pontchartrain, coming out of New Orleans--nothing but water, water,  water as far as the eye could see.)  Rick kept trying to get me up but I refused.  Finally we reached the library--not before we had to duck under a rusted  iron gate to get off of the irrigation canal.  Brian Neil was going to  go look up a book in the stacks--"The Ellington Concord".  We were going to do whatever.  Brian was going to meet us by the knee of some statue-- Elmer somebody--after he found his book.  We walked through a large  student center. A woman I'd met in another dream was selling  traditional handicrafts.  THere was a small exhibit by DJ----- and DJ---  in a glass case.  The case was filled with works on paper that somehow  changed images at set intervals.  Brian found us again; he hadn't been  able to find his book.  We were sitting in a large space that had  hundreds of folding chairs set up in it.  People were going to watch a  fashion/pet show.  Rick's friend Doug was sittig by Brian--they were making fun of the speaker.  Suddenly, half the audience, including many  women in fur coats, got up, screamed, and tried to race out of their  seats.  Someone had brought in a large cage.  I thought maybe it was a  snake.  "No," said Doug.  "It's a giant slug."    
6210 20030623004207 have you heard that the Dey of Algiers has a wart right under his nose?    dream of 6/20 (i'm in high school again, and again and again)   Dan McCarthy, Brendon Judge and the bad boys of my high school days, outside the vast and ill-maintained social studies library, refusing to go inside.  By the wax light of the covered porch, trying to convince them that they could come inside and learn.   dream of 6/21 (do not look at piero della francesca pictures before bed)   In a kitchen by the sea, someone was trying to be nice to me and I would not let them.  Later, in a field by a barbed wire fence, talking with the Gill girls about the big calves I had inherited from ancestors in South Italy.  Someone was confused by my explanation--they thought I'd inherited  thalassemia .  Three girls were running ahead of their teacher; I tried to get them to stay in line.  Sis Kate was by the seaside, just finishing up her day's work as a museum docent upon an old ice-crossing ship.  It was docked now on a permanantly ice and salt-encrusted sea.  Large animatronic seals and walruses lay on the ice around it; they had been turned off in mid-roll, scratch, or bellow.    In a still panel as though painted in a fresco of a church, figures knelt before a bishop or cardinal.  The kneeling people had their mouths agape, their tongues outstretched as though for old fashioned communion. The bishop was flicking something--I thought at first it might be holy water, but then I realized it has bits of the eucharist--using a black whip about seven inches tall that looked like a minature cat o' nine tales.    "The pelagra,"  someone said, next to me, and I realized I was looking at a painting or a projected image before me--I couldn't tell which--as someone talked about it.  "Made from human skin, skinned and woven even as the people's whose skins were being flayed were still alive."  I was filled with a sudden and incredible revulsion as scene upon scene of horrible cruelty and torture, all instituted and perpetuated by the Church, flashed before me in the same fresco style.  Suddenly all the color went to black and white.  The frescoes flashed before me like frames of a cruel movie.  The man showing us the images began to curse us: "Blasphamers!  Blasphemers, all!"  The cathedral we were suddenly standing in was full of the images, the sights and relics of the innumerable cruelties.  The camera of my eye panned rapidly from image to image, a bird's eye view of each.  I was talking with my friend Danielle; she introduced me to a member of the liberal conspiracy.  They were trying to implicate Cobey Delk, who had published some work under a French pseudonym, as an anti-semite. "You must read the book Oligarchy," the member of the conspiracy said.  I was on the narrow retaining wall of a building trying to find a way back down to the ground.  A family of four was with me, about twenty feet off the ground on the narrow brick escarpment.  A boy had been up there, at first--I'dd gone to get him down and gotten trapped there myself.  The whole family had followed me up there and pinned me in. One way and then another was too steep--we'd walk up six inch wide ornamental brick scallops, hoping to reach a roof from which we could jump to the ground.  I climbed gingerly across a narrow gutter--then looked down to find that I was now fifty feet above the ground.  The way back that I had come was blocked.  Suddenly a team of professional tournament archers appeared.  I realized I was at Disneyworld.  They were going to take shots at me.  They did, drawing blood.  "What in the hell?"  I said.  "I hate this place."  Suddenly all the bustle of the fake villages, the milling about of people, stopped. Crowds looked up in horror.    "What did you say?" commanded a booming voice from the sky.    "I'm done with this shit," I said, somehow getting down from the ledge. "I'm done with fake crises and beating up on people actually already in trouble."  I was running--guards were pursuing me.  All the while, I was trying to figure out how to get back in Disneyworld to wreak some havoc.   dream of 6/22 (to my dog on wheels)  It was a good day for my little ones, my students in the darkened classroom--lights turned off for coolness's sake.  Ms. Gonzales was scheduling the testing for ESL students.  I was congratulating my class on their good work.    I was driving through the back roads of an old residential section of a city.  It was the Turkish quarter, and I was driving straight through a Turkish bachelor party--men and women thronging the streets, singing and dancing, the night thick and black around them.  I was dressed in hijab, a white shimmering veil with gold beads and clear jewels encircling my forehead.  Only my eyes, kohl-rimmed, were showing.  Suddenly a man was in my car.  "You're like a ninja," he said.  "But watch out, for I'm"--and suddenly he was at my side--"as quick as you."  We were suddenly parked at the end of my parent's driveway; the sun was rising and my dad and Paul Staudt from high school orchestra were emerging from behind the Jensens, bearing equipment with which to watch some astronomical event.  I was supposed to have coordinated the viewing.    I was walking through a dimly lit bar, where sunlight came through mottled through heavy coarse curtains.  It was 12 am and still light out--the summer solstice at a far northern point.  We were going to have to wait until 3 am, when the brief total darkness would arrive, and then, almost immediately, the dawn.  Then a meeting would begin.  I was about to turn back but I wanted to sit outside for a bit.  Rick and Brandon were walking ahead; I was walking and talking with Sean Keane. But when I got outside he turned into Matthew Neil, bearer of prodigious knowledge of all the Latin names and botanical lore of native plants.  We were all sitting at a rough hewn table and I was impossibly tired. Matthew was pointing out an unusual variety of honey locust.  "Most drop their bloom right away to bear fruit.  This one will retain its blossom, at the expense of reproducing, to heal," he said.  The pale pink blooms of the tree, soft and fragrant, were drifting down on me. 
6265 20030124115407 Silent Lucidity   I woke up at 6 a.m. remembering this dream but not wanting to, so I went back to bed.  The only scene I can remember now was my first glimpse of a strange figure--a tall man with a white beard, with grey hair kind of straggly at the sides but fairly short, with face ridged as though he had been cut many times and the wounds had scarred and left hills and valleys criss-crossing his face.  He had one cut beneath his eye that was fresh and still bleeding.  He was walking with a limp across a darkened room.  There were some dim events that I cannot remember.  The only thing I remember with anything resembling clarity is this man's face and the paranoid feeling that someone else was manipulating my dream.  (I think that's why I didn't want to remember it: because it seemed very strange to be dreaming that someone else was controlling my dream.)    a major (non-dream) digression  (This dream fragment leads to an interesting point, and I will digress from recording dreams to note it.  This marks at least the second time (and really probably the tenth or so, if I don't let vanity and pride stand in the way of me speaking truthfully) that I have made some sort of sleeping or waking decision to emphasize or de-emphasize portions of my dreams.    Part of that is inevitable--despite my capacity to note and record trivial details and facts that do not contribute to my arguments, to a degree that would strike wonder even into the heart of, say, a bad ethnographer--I'm still going to emphasize portions of my dreams, and de-emphasize others, if I lay them out in a narrative, as I have been doing.  So, skipping over the discussion of whether it is important to find out about or make note of things I have made a decision not to include (I will only note briefly that I think the things any author or person chooses not to reveal, and the ways in which she does so, can be as important as the things she does talk about) here are two things I have been thinking of.    One is a new layout for this page, which will basically consist of a sidebar in which I list all the random things, presumably in chronological order, that I can remember from the dream.  (Some of them are just descriptions of images, I guess:  "Wendy Romer with her head shaved," for example, which showed up in a dream the other day and which I remembered out of chronological order and had no connection to anything else.)  Certain items in the sidebar would then be expanded and form part of the dream narrative.  I don't know when or if this will actually happen.  Then there is something that my friends and I were talking about this holiday: representing timelines in three dimensions.  How do you do it, firs of all, and how could you construct a timeline that emphasizes a particular historical progression--say, the history of railroads, to pick something I really wouldn't want to make a timeline about--but simultaneously places it in context of other historical progressions, and shows the links between events, and the relative weight/importance of those links?    We wanted to make it a web in which you would enter, and through which you would proogress, vaguely on the x-axis, I guess.  This x-axis would show events that show the progression of railroads, to continue with our unfortunate example. And of course you could use color, whatever, to show their relative importance, or causal links between them.  Meanwhile, on the y-axis at any given point you'd see (or hear or feel or experience) the events that were historically concurrent with the point you were at.  They would be displaced on the z-axis depending on the strength of their "link" (I think this word is careening perilously close to landing on Rick's banned word list) to the point/event where you were standing--the closer the two events, in space, the more influenc they had upon each other.  Meanwhile, even events thoughout the timeline that were distant in time but causally or otherwise related would still be associated in some fashion (some combination, say, of color-coding and, oh, twine.  Or dental floss.) :)  I'm sure this has been done before in some form or another, and most likely described more coherently, so if you have any idea where, please tell me so I can check it out (and make my own version).   We Resume Our Normally-Scheduled Programming   Later on in my dream, I was at a family gathering in a house that could have been my Nanny and Pop-Pop's old place, but wasn't.  Their dining room table was in it, though, fully expanded as though Nanny were expecting a lot of company.  And indeed, all the Branca gang was there, little kids running around the house, adults talking and of course eating.  My Uncle Joe was carrying various little kids around the house.  He had his dress shirt off and was walking around in his short-sleeved undershirt like my Pop-Pop used to.  My Uncle Joe had a cut under his eye, bleeding like the weird man in my other dream.  I was at some point sitting at the table with my Aunt Doreen and some other people.  I had a fake stuffed rat, black, and my aunt was talking about the old albino rat we used to have as a pet (in real life),   Melchisedec .(I named him after the rat in   A Little Princess   and only when I was about twenty found out that Melchisedech was an ancient Hebrew king.)  I had saved a giant steamed Chinese dumpling for my dad and I wanted to make sure he got it.  When I went to find him, he was watching a young version of my cousin Wes play paino.  Wes was making up amazing melodies, but I couldn't figure out if he was playing them or if it was a player piano,  Anyway, he seemed to have the fingerings down--he looked like a three-year-old trained concert pianist.  Meanwhile, my dad was asking me to help shine a small adjustable desk lamp up on a spot above the beams.  (We were in my other grandmother's living room, now, but it was dark, as though all the shades were drawn and the windows barred up.)  My dad was challenging my cousin Collin to a game of skill--they were going to toss a foam ball up at the spot of light that I was shining above the beams.  I did not have my glasses on, and it was so dim I really had no clue where my father wanted me to shine the light.   
6294 20050306222207 You are not the same people who left that station  First there were three adolescent boys inside of our house and two kept attacking us with shovels and knives as though they had been possessed by the devil.  They had come to our house accidentally and had turned evil while they were there.  I had escaped from them just long enough to warn Rick and the other kid whom we had befriended.  The evil boys came upstairs with two shovels each and an assortment of knives. Rick and I hid in the studio and were able to disarm them.  We shepherded them downstairs just as the mom of one of bad boys, who had turned into a small, straggly haired girl of ten, arrived, angry, to bring him/her home.  I was walking across a giant concrete bridge over a wide river, and it almost seemed like the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge in the valley.  I was thinking about what it would take to shoot a series of photos there of me walking across the river when the water level was lower, in the summer.  I was trying to catch up to Rick, who was moving ever faster.  On the other side, there was a walkway made of uneven wooden slats.  The walkway twisted and dropped precipitously to the banks of the river below -- we were still nearly fifty feet above the shore.  Sometimes the floor of the walkway would drop off and you would have to jump about a foot down and a couple of inches over to catch the next section of ramp.  I walked across, scared. I realized suddenly I had dropped several things from my purse.  I could see one group of them on another section of the walkway, although I couldn't see clearly how to get there -- the twists and turns between that point and where I currently stood were labyrinthine.  I was sadder when I saw that an old book I had taken from a pile of my father's current reading material had fallen from my bag and dropped all the way down to a floating dock beside the shore, some seven or eight feet out in the water from the bank, and some seven or eight feet below the raised walkway, fifty feet below me.  The book was "Practical Carpentry", or perhpas "Instructional Woodworking" and the binding, of green-brown leather, was old but not fraying. The book was from the beginning of the last century and gave off the magical, weighty feeling of hardcover books from long ago.  I set off down the walkway again determined to recover the book and the items from my bag.  Suddenly the walkway turned into the gangway of a ship.  The ship was a deluxe ship, like a first-class passenger train in colonial India.  The labyrithine system of walkways, paths that led nowhere, multiple exits and entrances, and general confusion prevailed. I was not going to be able to recover my books, I feared.  The ship was about to dock.  I ran to the top deck.  The day was sparkling clear.  A woman with blond hair with some official capcity on the boat said she could help me.  We stepped into the water, which was clear blue like tropical seas.  Behind us the ferry (for that is what is was) was churning its motors in preparation for entry into the harbor.    We floated on in the somehow forward wake of the ship.  Things that I thought looked like Russian otters were coming towards us.  As we approached one another I realized they were hundreds of different species of dogs -- large and tiny, of all different coats and colors, all gamboling in the waves almost like dolphins.    "Oh, it's the Pistchios," the woman said.  I looked at her quizzically and she elaborated.  "They are animatronic creations and they are being released as part of the Pistchio project."  I understood that the dogs were going to swim across the sea and their arrival would be welcomed with festivities and celebration.  The woman reached out to pet one so I did too -- they reacted like friendly dogss, lifting up their muzzles so we could pet them, nuzzling against our hands.  They swam by us, a few smaller ones still paddling in the high seas.  We came almost seconds later to a stand of bulls, black and red, in the water -- not robots but real -- and horses, too, who put their noses against our upturned palms to snort and nuzzle.  A crab had attached itself to me.  "Oh, that's all right, as long as it's not one of those one-clawed ones that fastent hemselves to your neck," the lady said.  I spotted my stuff -- a stick of lipgloss, my day planner, notes on things I ahd to do, an old calendar from college that I was planning on turning in real life into a letter-book for my childhood friend, a comb -- some other things, too -- I reached out of the boat I was lying in, which was just me sized, fitted perfectly for me to lie down in -- I grabbed for the things and clung to the floating dock where they were even as the ferry/small boat pushed away from it and towards shore.  "Leave it," said the woman, "you can't get it all," but I was trying and trying,s tretching my arms out even farther, until I had put it all, slightly soaked, into the tiny boat, which was sewn out of leather and beginning to fill with water.  We had docked.  It was night and I was the only non-ship emplyoee still on board.  I was trying to ask the captain of the ship, a dark haired woman who looked and spoke like she was from the Philippines, if I could go down to the dock to find my book.  She kept pretending not to understand me, and perhaps she didn't.  Finally her friend explained my predicament, and the woman said, "Ahh!  You tell us what the book looks like and wher to find it and we look for it tomorrow!  I never like to look in the dark."  I didn't like this and planned on looking myself once I got free of her. But I explained that they would find the book on the floating dock next to the ship, that it was an old book and important to me, among other reasons, because it had been my dad's and because I needed to learn how to work with wood.  I looked out at sea to where people were folding away the strange gangways of the ship.  Suddenly I realized that we had travelled in space and time since I had dropped the book on the floating dock.  I realized I would never be able to reclaim the book because I would never return to that same floating dock where I had left it; I did not even know where that dock was.  It was night and I did not know where we had landed either. 
6296 20030608173607 god loves his children   We had had a holiday dinner at my Granny's and now we were trying to clean up.  The actual dinner, though, had been held outside, at a covered picninc shelter.  I had gone to the kitchen to ask my Granny what I could start taking in.  She was holding up a plate with a large, plastic looking bottom slice of ham on it.  "The roast beef," she said, but she made as though to give me the tray of ham, so I was uncertain whether she wanted me to take it in for the other people to eat.  "No, no," she said.  "Bring the roast beef in."  Suddenly more people were standing around the sink, washing up.  The fastest way to the covered shelter was through the sink disposal unit.  I had gone down through there before, I knew, but I was suddenly scared.  What if my aunt turned it on--accidentally or intentionally--as I was travelling through it?  What if I got stuck?  I put one leg down through it.  From a normal size drain unit it expanded wide enough to accomodate my calf.  Suddenly I was even more disturbed.  I felt it pulling on me, the slime of decaying vegetables on my feet, but I struggled out of it.  An alien visitation kept following my friend.  The alien itself was a beautiful dark haired boy, about sixteen, who floated around, often backwards, and occassionally touched down on the ground to quake, tremble and rock.  We were on a wooden ramp, high above the sea.  My friend, for some reason, was still on the far shore, and I was alone with her alien visitation.  I suddenly realized that this could mean that we were both experiencing the same hallucination, that someone was tricking us, or that the alien was real.  I saw myself as in the frame of a comic book.  I was hanging on the edge of the high wooden dock, calling out to my friend.  The sky was rendered in pen and ink, and the sea below was deep, cross hatched and shadowy.    I called to my friend, "Hurry up and come out.  I'm not very good at hei--"  Then I fell fifty feet into the soundless ocean.  I saw, again as in a comic strip, a frame of the three of us, falling through the water; then in real time the three of us, me sinking and struggling, then all of us emerging and the alien and my friend pulling me up to support me.  We swam to a wooden ramp, midway out in the water.  It was pitched at a forty-five degree angle; once you started walking on it you found yourself irresistibly drawn back into the water.  My friend circumvented it, but I once again wound up in the water.  I swam about a hundred feet to the same thing, another dock on which I emerged, walked upon, and fell back into the water, in a night without stars or moon, the water dark and thick as oil.    After the second ramp, once again in the water, I realized I was swimming through  a sea of hair.  It was coarse and black, but straight and only about five inches long.  There were great coils of it floating like dead snakes everywhere.  I couldn't tell if it was from humans or from other animals.  On the bank, the grounds of a great university, women were laying with animals behind bushes.  The animals were chained or held by burly men, their trainers.   The alien had been transformed into a child, and my friend and I were taking her to a clinic.  We were waiting--my friend didn't have the needed vaccines to allow her to care for a child, and so my friend needed to undergo a special screening beore the doctor could even examine the small child.  The alien child was precocious.  She was pretending not to know how to use a pacifier.  Another woman in the office was playing around, pretending to put the pacifier in her ear.  The alien child though this was great fun and she started to pretend to do things that were silly.  She tuned into my student Jeli.  Suddenly, I was looking over a vast city, spread out like Houston but with the skyline of Nashville to the northwest.  My student Jeli was alone on the streets.  Masses of people were assembling for a gang war in the improbably clean street, cobblestoned like Boston.  From a distance I saw Jeli, surrounded by other small children who would soon get caught up in the fighting.  I saw her and the skyline simultaneously; I sat at some distance.  Down the highway our aline friend had returned in another guise--a half-hispanic, half-black kid with an angelic, dark-circled face and an afro like a halo. He wass wearing a track suit and riding along on the tops of very tall construction equipment, like cranes and demolition screws.  I knew we needed to run to Jeli.  As we arrived, she was still standing there as more and more people, mostly high school and early adult age, begin assembling.  I took her by the hand and started pulling her away, but she didn't want to go.  She had a dollar and fifty cents in her tiny hand, and she wanted to spend it.  We scooted through the open air pavillion where people were gathering, through narrow alleys of skyscrapers out into an open street. I told Jeli that we were going to buy jello, two flavors, but it was really Kool-Aid that I meant, I think.  The other woman took Jeli's other hand and I convinced Jeli to put her money in her pockets.  Two young women with flattened blond hair and dark eye makeup had pulled up along the curb.  They were eyeing us, and as they stared I had a premonition of the sort you get in movies when the foreshadowing is very apparent.  These two women were going to try to do something bad to us later, and we had the potential to prevent it now.  I hurried us across the street--the women still in the car, watching us--and thought about hiding in a doorway.  But all the shops were closed.  It was too late to try to get back home, back to our neighborhood which would be relatively safe, although riots would rage across the city that night and for many nights after.  We found an open door and I realized that it led to a shop owned by the same folks that ran the soul food place.  We walked through the shop--it was all  African-American beauty products--then walked through another set of doors into a store featuring all African-American home furnishings and flowing clothing.  Finally we came to a set of double frosted glass doors, and beyond, the soul food place.  I knew that, at least for the time being, we would be safe here. 
6391 20030216225407 two fer the price o'one   (Rick and I just got back from adventures in snowy Cleveland with his fam; thus I bring you not one, but two belated dream installations.)    Some Freudian Slips, and Veils   These are verbatim from the Hampton Inn paper I scribbled on when I woke up.  It's funnier that way.  2/15  In my dream I dreamt I woke.  I was walking through the night, warm night like the summers of el Valle.  In my dream I was going to stop when I got to the funky coffehouse--on my way to the shop I was practicing tae kwan do kicks on the garbage cans before sharecropper shacks. Inside the coffeeshop cool kids with cool pants were hanging out.  Although I had thirteen dollars in my pocket--a ten dollar, a two dollar, and a one dollar bill--I wasn't going to pay nine dollars and ninety-five cents for french-pressed coffee.  By the restroom, just beyond the metal and chrome counter, there were black and white photos with writing scratched or etched into them, as though part of the photo development process.  Just before this I had been hanging with my mom at an old-fashioned diner.  Some of her friends were going to show up, maybe, to play cards.  But there was general skepticism as to whether or not that would occur.  Italian American custodians, middle-aged or older, were hanging out in the diner trying to pick me up.  During this same portion of the dream, I started watching a Disney movie with some people who eventually became Rick and his family.  We were seeing a movie that vaguely resembled Aladdin, a Disney contemporary-style cartoon.  A youngish (15 year-old) girl was moping about gracefully in veils on a rooftop palazzo--the Aladdin-style suitor was writing a letter on a piece of parchment at a table.  Finally he finished and swept open a large window.  He handed the rolled-up parchment to a flying passenger pigeon/wood duck-type bird.   "Why didn't you tell me that's what you were doing?" the princess asked, a little petulantly.  The princess lowered her veils so her costume looked like that of a  Jordanian Bedouin .  Then she danced.  To Aladdin she said, "Scouting, scouting. Pretend we're scouting."  Then followed a weird dance sequence a la a Bollywood movie.   An evil advisor kept looking in, a shadowy form appearing at the windows.  The scene switched to the princess's evil father, summoning one of his viziers--"Kill this ________", referring to Aladdin, the father said.  He couldn't curse because it was a Disney movie.   "Sire, the forces are fleeing the palace already," the vizier replied, and indeed, a great host, like Saruman's in The Two Towers, was marching from the palace.    "So it is," said the father.  "So you must go," he said to the vizier.  The princess appeared with a crystal harp that glowed when the state of the kingdom was in peril.  Its figurehead, a small cherub, was glowing briliantly.   "Father,' she said, holding the harp.  "You must flee."  She didn't realize her father's wickedness, or she still felt pity for him.  He wouldn't heed her, so she fired a shot from the bow that always came to the aid of its owner, and always knew the right target to seek.  It hit the crystal tip of her father's spear/magic staff.  There was a prophetic vision of the wicked father going off to battle on a rain-drenched plain.  He went to use his spear in battle and it, being broken, failed him.  He was killed.  The cartoonist had done a crazy thing here, in the prophetic sequence.  The prophetic scene was composed of still frames, like a comic book, but an optical illusion of printing made lines of grey, white, black and brown shimmer across the warriors' bodies like falling streaks of rain.  I wanted to know how I could do that when I made linocuts; in my dream I imagined I could make a four-color print somehow move like that.  That's where I gave up on the movie in disgust.  I turned back to Rick with scorn in my mouth.  "So that's how it ends, with the implication that the girl is indirectly responsible for killing her father through her love for that boy?" I asked Rick in disbelief.   "I hate fuckin' Disney," I said.  "Bunch of fuckin' Freudians."  Ingrid's house; the large dogs, each of whom had lost a little weight; the block of ice that I though was a snow sculpture that turned out to be a large, puppet-like cat.  Another cat, and the tiny baby, less than a year, that was somehow able to crawl and talk.  Ingrid was trying to teach the baby about the five parts of an egg.  She had a song a la "I Like Hubcaps", if only in that Franz Shoebert kept interrupting in his funny voice to tell us what a part of the egg was  not .  2/16  I was hangin' with the Muslim women.  We were in a temporary building, a trailer, where food supplies were being stored.  Small children were being brought in and out.  It was a sort of daycare.  I was trying to think through my reasons for staying there.  The women did not accept me, but they tolerated me.  A man was starting an Arabic radio station.  Men were calling in songs for him to play; only men could call in to play songs.  I was the man starting the radio station.    There was another section; I cannot remember it.    The subdivision cul-de-sac at an odd hour of day that seemed like golden light of dawn.  The evil dolly--in pink tutu with burning eyes--we wanted to throw it away but couldn't.  Zara the witch--walking down the road in long blue wrap dress, muttering to herself.  The tiny vicious beast on the front lawn--looked like a cross between a wolf and a pig.  It ran away a bit when I tried to make myself look bigger, holding a mailbox above my head--but only to the house's foundation--then it charged again at me, full speed.  Laying next to sis Kate on a fancy godess-style  divan . Somebody smelled really bad and I was trying to figure out who it was.  Then I realized it was me and I was really embarrased.  We were driving in a convertible, Rick and I and a bunch of friends--on a mountainous road somewhere from my memory of Crystal Brook Hollow.  Rick and I were kissing but someone in the car was pulling on my big toe.    "Wait," said the person pulling my toe.  "What I want to know is will five or more friends always live together?" I was thinking of the five friends I would have live with me until we died. But I didn't know if Rick and I had to pick together or if we could pick separately.   
6498 20060106103408 In the sprawling house, getting ready for someone's graduation.  We were leaving shortly but I had done nothing to get ready.  Rick had cut his thumb and at first I just tried to wrap a bandage around the old bandage he had on it, but he reminded me that that was unsanitary.  I ran downstairs to get a new band-aid.  Down there I was trying to clean out the messy bathroom.  People, mostly associates of my sisters', kept coming in.  We are running a quasi-boarding house (not regularly but because of the special cirucumstances of this week).  I have to move one of their packages of specialized face wash.  I find the bandage but need to ask someone else to bring it up because the bathroom is messy and I know my mom wants it cleaned.    But by the time I finish and make my way up the wide staircase again (it looks like one of the stairways in a train terminal), myfamily is already leaving for the graduation.  I'm still in my pjs.  I ask my dad if Kate is still up there and when he says that she is, I tell him I'll ride in with her.    Kate is sitting on the side of the bed in a scarf of stripes.  I tell her I'llbe ready just after I shower.  But we hear sirens from outside and we are unsure exactly what they mean -- tornado or car theft or fire.  We run downthe wide stairs and see, outside across the lawn, the wide marble steps of alarge manor house, illuminated inside.  An ambulance is taking out someone on a stretcher.  It is our friend Leslie.    "Had you heard about Leslie?" I ask Kate.  "Yes, she has been having open heart surgery the past three days," Kate says.   We go to find the men who drove the ambulance she rode in, to thank them.  The guy who dorve the ambulance is sitting midway up the steps we had just come down.  We thank him and his partner, feeling a little foolish but more than anything overwhelmingly grateful.  (some time passed but i cannot remember)  I was trying to return to the spot I had been at just a few minutes ago, in the residential neighborhood surrounded by woods.  A woman on the radio is talking abouta facecream used by "Mexican laborers" to keep their skin and brains youthful and supple.  "That's why a Lolo Nino of sixty will have the mind and face of twenty", she says.  I turn the radio off.  I am lost, but I see where I can cut through a rocky driveway to get to the street I need.  This is the lot where the Mexican families live.  There is one fo the most beautiful houses I have ever seen.  It is roughly octoganal, about sixty feet across and thirty-five feet high.  It is made entirely of sticks and tree trunks and its walls and ceiling are open to the air and sky.  On one side there are some twining vines holding it together.  The effect is of a rustic cathedral.  I am going to stop but my car pulls me onward.  I realize suddenly that I have re-stumbled on to the orchard I discovered years ago in my dreams and that I had always wanted to go back to but could never refind.  This time I have found it from the opposite direction, not from the main road, but from these new developments that have sprung up.  In my dream that one prior time I would come here and eat the fruit right off the vines and trees, and they were endowed with extraordinary deliciousness and a sort of magic.  But I see that the farmer has sold off most of the orachard to allow these houses to be built.  He has kept only a few rows of grape vines and some indeterminate trees, scraggly in winter.  But nonetheless I am so happy to be here.  In other dreams I have had the feeling of being just around the corner from this place but until this dream I have never been able to return.  I look at the ground and see a shed snake skin in the rutted mud of the dirt road.  There in the high dry grass is a snake with a chopped off tail; I can't see if it is a rattler.  The snake is approaching me, looking as though it is going to attack.  Looking closer I see that it is two snakes intertwined, fighting one another and rolling over on the ground.  There is a pile of shed snake skins just in front of a bush.  I am backing away from the snakes, who draw nearer and nearer.  Suddenly they are jumping up by my neck, and a big dog (black?) is jumping up behind me to drive them away.  The man who owns the orchard is standing across the way in a patchwork jacket.  "It's okay," he says, "I've chopped up all those snakes."  I look and indeed there is a pile of snakes with tails chopped off, writhing in a ball like a nest of vipers.  I take a single skin, isolated from the rest, fold it and hold it for later use.  The old man is showing me his rows and rows of patchwork clothing, fabric, and other designs, hanging in rows where the orchard plants used to be.  The designs are all beautiful - utilitarian yet rich and colorful and with great tailoring.  He sews all the pieces by hand.  He will try to sell them and see how it goes.  He is about sixty-nine or seventy years old.  "Come on, I want to show you something," he says.  So I follow.  We go past the building made of sticks, then go inside.  "Big heating bills are in this year, I suppose," the man says.  "Save on building materials, pay for it in heat," I say.  The floors and walls are finished out in plywood.  Walking up a flight of stairs, I realize how rickety the are, how flimsy the floorboards. When we get to the landing, we come to a tee-intersection with a narrow flight of stairs extending up sharply in one direction straight ahead, and a narrow hallway with awindow at hte end of it to our right.  The man tells me to go forward through the narrow hallway, then loop around.  The floorboards are so thin that I am trying to walk really lightly so as to be sure not to fall through.  I climb another set of stiars, then another, and this last one is so rickety that it is swaying.  I get almost to the top, where it is unfinished.   "There," the old man says, pointing.  "Can you see that skyline?"  I can't see anything, but I don't actually say this to him.  Im straining to see what he's pointing out but at the same time I'm afraid of the swaying staircase.  I can see out the windows busy cranes and the overpasses and shadows of highways and skyscrapers.  "Can you hear the traffic outside, the hum of the world?" he says.  "That is how things will be, the direction of the future."  He is holding the banister and shakign the stairs.  He notices my fear.    "Oh, some of these stairs must not be reinforced," he says.  "Come on, let's go."  
6515 20030221104808 Down by the River   There had been so much rain, and the swollen river strained at its rock lined banks.  The sun was out, brilliantly, and I walked along the banks, looking down into the river, which flowed like a moat or a walkway-less Riverwalk along shops and offices.  Then of course I leaned over too far, looking at the texture of the rocks and the slimy looking water, and fell in. I was almost swept away by the current, but I grabbed onto rock outcroppings along the otherwise sheer and unclimable ten or twelve foot high banks.  I started swimming against the current with all my might.    I wordlesly begged for help from a woman in a glass-panelled office directly opening onto the river.  She stepped out of her glass door--before I had time to warn her just to call for help-- and fell into the river.  I caught her and we swam together.  People on the bank were telling us who would rescue us, but they were also reminding me that it was the third time I'd fallen into a flooded river (which is actually true in real life, sadly enough). Finally, Italian-American custodians fished us out of the river with huge poles with gaffing hooks(?) on the end.   There was a camping/car parking area in an open field bordered by woods.  Some unkown group of people and I were setting up camp.   Hundreds of sea birds were swooping low before our heads, congregating in the open field as they sometimes do before storms.  There were terns and kestrels, a solitary  curlew , a  white ibis  with flecks of blue plumage trying to preen off slimy arthropods crawling all over it.  Later, in another dream, Rick and I and a few other people we didn't know well were sitting around a table in a bar.  Two other men in their late twenties had been sitting at the table with us, but they got up at some point after somebody at the table made a comment about not having enough room.   Somehow the atmosphere grew ugly--one of the people remaining at the table, a woman, decided that two men that had left were up to no good.  She went into the other room to follow them and came back with another woman from our table who had gotten up at the same time that the men had.  The men had been taunting her, telling her that she was ugly and criticizing her teeth.  [I write it as I remember it, folks.]  This somehow angered the people remaining at our table--including Rick--who all clambored for vengeance.  I thought that going into the other room in this unfamiliar bar in an unfamiliar city (we were visitors) was a bad idea, so I raced ahead to try to prevent an encounter by distracting the men who had left the table and teased the woman.  In the other room, I was trying to talk to the men and dissuade them from fighting. Somewhere in my dream logic, I thought that using the men's names as much as possible would focus their attention away from fighting to what I was saying. I was stalling until I could think of something more; I was going to try to get them to follow me outside, out of the bar.  It was working for a bit; then one of them tricked me by having someone else impersonate him for a moment (it is easy to be duped in dreams).    In the meantime, while I was talking to his impersonator,the guy had bellied up to the bar where Rick was standing.  He caught Rick by surprise by throwing a glass of liquor in his face--then he cracked Rick over the head and across the face with a bottle.  Rick fell to the floor behind the bar, seemingly unconscious.  I was furious (although sadly negligent in checking Rick's pulse).  I walked up to the guy that had hit Rick with a bottle, took him by the collar, and handed him another bottle.  I was shaking.    "Go on and hit me," I said.  "Go on and use this bottle."  I was inches away from his face; I could see stubble on his chin.  Suddenly in my heart I forgave him.  I started talking really fast; I tried saying his name out loud many times, explaining that I forgave him, that I wanted only good for him.    He stood with the bottle upraised; he didn't say anything.  We were both crying.  I walked over to Rick and picked him up; he was limp, like a doll.  I carried him over my shoulder for a while and then propped him up.  He stood beside me, leaning heavily on me as we walked.  He had a huge crescent gash running across his face, from his eyebrow across his cheek to his lip. Someone rushed up and asked what they could to do to help.  "Would you call an ambulance," I said, "and tell them to go to ----", which was Rick's mom's place.    We walked there--it was a little bit away.  When we got there I called the ambulance operator myself.  He told me to take Rick's pulse.  "Is it non-existent?  Slow?  Fast?"  Rick's heart was racing.  Rick had recovered.  I explained that he had been in a fight.  He went to call and cancel the ambulance.  Lana's house was weird: I was in a suite of rooms, trying to get dressed.  I was in the bathroom, itself about two rooms in size, but it opened up into Lana's room, and I made a wrong turn and ended up there. I kept trying to flush Lana's toilet, which was oddly part of her bathtub. Green slimy ooze-like stuff kept coming out of where the jets of water normally shoot out of a toilet bowl.  The more I flushed the more ooze came out. Suddenly it started dripping out of facucets and by the seams of water pipes.   I was trying to get out of the room and tell Lana or Rick that something was wrong.  I opened the door and my Aunt Maddy was there.  I looked back in the room and my Uncle James was there, wearing a powder-blue skull cap and baby blue tie.  He was sitting on a chair and putting on socks.    "Aaah!  How did you get in here?" I asked James.  "I'm threatening you," he said mockingly.  But I realized it was a joke, though it was still strange.  My cousin Collin came in as well, and both Collin and James were showing me catalog pictures of the household pets they were training.  My aunt Maddy was watching over us.    We went outside; w were going to take an informal family portrait  with everyone in my mom's extended family.  I was in the back row.  There was some consternation because tall people were standing in front, blocking the view of small cousins.  Things were figured out; tall people went to the back.  Yet when it came time to take the photo, suddenly someone was obscuring me. I tried to stop the pictue from being taken, but people used up the rest of their film shooting the same shot, in which I alone in my family was present but invisible.  
6581 20030803124608 I was teaching Bryce how to tell the difference between a bath mat and a bath towel.  I had taken some pen and ink supplies with me on a plane and now they were sitting on the floor in a jumbled heap: they had been damaged in transit, so I picked up the tray where they were sitting and went to sort them out.  I was in a car approaching a fancy restaurant. Julie Sola was going to be there, and I had several packages and cards to give to her.  I drove my car into the shop where she worked and where people were cleaning up and getting ready for a new seasonal display. The shop was in an old shop garage.  Kate Moss came up to my car, pointing to a large slick spot on the floor.    "Oil?" I asked.  "Car fluid," she said.  "You really shouldn't leave your car on top of it."  So I turned round and backed out, after Julie had done the same. Then I pulled out and parked in one of the spaces directly behind the shop.  Two people materialized by my car--Marisa Mangiamelli, from my high school, and somebody else--Shannah Varon, maybe, from the Valley. Shannah at first had been driving behind me, talking to me on her cell phone, telling me all about the journal she had kept about living with her agoraphobic boyfriend.  But I was having trouble understanding what she was saying.  I told her that it was hard to talk ont he cell phone while I was driving and her car materialized behind mine.  She pulled over and got in mine.  The woman driving with us turned into the lady, Bridgette, who coordinates Vanderbilt's Great Performances series.  She and Shannah were talking about the good points of keeping a journal such as the one Shannah had.  THey sounded like a script from a Teach for America training session:  "So, when you write, do you use the Principles of Good Teaching as your starting points for reflection?" Bridgette asked.  "Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I just write down what happened during the day, my reactions."  "I tried to structure mine by picking a particular principle to focus on for the week.  Then every day I'd write down what I had and had not done to live up to that principle.  And at the end of the week, I'd review how I'd done in regards to all the principles."  "Bull shit," I was thinking to myself.  But out loud I said, "That must be useful."  Then we were at a t-intersection as night fell in a big city.  Up until this point it had been interminable dusk, the sky a rich royal blue and the air thick like smoke with the falling night.  But now it was dark and a middle-aged woman decked out in a silk jungle printed blouson jacket, a white cahmere top beneath it, poufy hair and a large gold necklace with a gold-embalmed scallop shell on it appeared from behind a manhole cover and a bunch of construction cones.  Now Julie Sola was driving.  She saw the woman and honked; the woman walked by almost as though ignoring us, but at the last minute came by with a bunch of gifts for all the people in the car but me.  I was the only non-employee of theshop where Julie worked.  We went back to the shop, now a fancy restaurant.  I had on a funny grey cotton long-sleeve shirt and boxer shorts and a hand-crocheted afghan which I wrapped around me tightly as I sat down.  The wait staff were all English, or all pretending to be.  For some reason a big bowl of beans and franks was placed before me.  A woman came by with big steaming pots of tea--"Care for some purple plum tea?" she asked, waving her two pots of tea aout.  Someone said yes--"Damn good cuppa," the waitress said, leaving the pot on the table.   Wait staff came in through double doors at the fron of the restaurant and stood with arms and menus curled before them like Balinese dancers. Then they sat, and when I looked at them next they were serving each other off big platters, then holding these same platters high up beneath their chins and eating directly fromt ehm.  They sang a song of praise to the restaurant as they did so.  "It's..." I started--and then I tried to glimpse the name of the restaurant on the flashing marquee outside.  "It's Starlite Restaurant, the Musical," I finished, as I glimpsed "Down Town Starlite Restaurant" in flashing lights outside the double doors.  As I spoke, a gorup of high school and college age students emerged from the wings of the restaurant, singing and dancing in unison.    "Cameras rolling," someone said behind me.  Then I saw the whole short segment as it would appear on film, the servers serving each other and dining at the fancy tables with the rest of the patrons; the troupe of youth kicklining their way to the middle of the restaurant, where tthree or four of their company took turns extolling the virtues of community involvement; the voice over from the camera person explaining how this was just one in a series of promotional shorts produced by Starlite Restaurant "to bring more news to the youth of the city".  Then t he frame switched to the picture of the ashen grey legs of a woman.  The camera gradually panned up to sweep over her heavy hands on the heads of two small black-haired children, all of them standing on chairs in a dirt lined house.  It swept upwards to her head, grotesquely small for her body.  It zoomed in as the voice over intoned, "And tonight--the story of Domnique Palenque.  Abandoned by her husband on the Mexican- American border, she struggled to fid a way to bring her children and herself across the Arizona desert into the Untited States.  She scraped together just enough money to pay off a "lupe," a people-smuggler.  But she was abandoned by him and left for dead, along with ehr children, in the middle of the blazing arid Arizona desert.  Somehow, she managed to carry her two children to safety, providing enough nourishment for them to survive."  The camera focused on her head, the size and shape of a small wild cat, tapering almost to a snout at the bridge of her nose, her mouth stretched into a tight cat smile.  Small whiskers were beginning to appear along her nostrils.    "This is the result of arid desert conditions, poor nutrition, and a hereditary condition which limited the size of Dominique's trachea," the voice-over continued.  "She is currently receiving treatment for the condition, which if untreated can result in complete metamorphosis of the face, and gradual closing of the tracheal system.  Dominique is scheduled for surgery this week, but she has no means of paying for it. Officials are still not certain how she was able to provide for her children during the arduous journey through the desert.  More at eleven." 
6739 20030902001008 8/26 Someone was going to kill me--so I ran quickly across a darkened parking lot, into the back entrance of a university research facility.  My mom's art classroom was to the side--I hid in floor to ceiling closet as people's footsteps echoed nearer and neare.  It was my would-be killer and my mom, my killer claiming that he needed to find and talk to me--my mom agreeing--and my killer laying down money before my mom, she refusing it.  Then suddenly he went away, down the hall, and I scrambled down, explained to my mom what was happening, and rehid myself in the closet. He was going to find me anyway.  8/27 There had been a tornado.  I was trying to braid my hair, which was suddenly long and golden, into two long pigtails.  But as I separated my hair, first into two sections, one on either side of my head, and then into three plaits on each side, I realized I had chunks of different colored and textured hair--including a section of coarse grey salt and pepper hair, wiry and close to my head, and a disgusting section of pink scalp with only little tufts of doll style hair emerging from tiny indentations.   Later I waited in cramped quarters before a stage for orchestra rehearsal to begin--but the g string on my viola had broken and I had no new strings to put on my instrument.  Earlier kids had gathered round trying to beat down a pinata--I went off to my car to get hats, gloves, scarves--it was cold, the true beginning of a chilly fall.  I was walking with Brandon.  I skated down a glassy hill on my shoes, talked with an old man as I reached the bottom.  He thanked me for some chocolate I had sent him, in a faraway voice reminiscent of a voice that would emanate from beneath the ground or a toadstool.  8/28 Kate and I were driving through the city, impossibly sprawled out, dark green foliage against grey concrete like a 60s state university architect's dream of what environmentalism would look like.  We got on I-40 westbound and drove through narrow streets with highrises looming on either side.  We were trying to get to stores--we passed a large Home Depot tricked out like a castle along the water.  We passed the river--on and on we drove, Kate finally insisting we turn around.  =20  We were in a shopping complex.  K was asking me to get her dinner and I was explaining that I had no money--she had been complaining to our mom that I had eaten all her snack food.  Then I was with sis Sass in a Chinese buffet line--something to do with literary theory was transpiring in the restaurant, and there we were, getting fried rice and veggies.  By the time I got up to the serving tray the Mexican man who was dishing out main dishes had served all the fried rice.  All that was left were corn tortillas and curried carrot mush.  I was talking in Spanish with him.  When I asked for "un pocito mas," he asked me to say how much and the only phrase I could think of was "mezzo tazza".  He corrected me with the proper Spanish word for half-cup and gave me a whole bunch of fried chiles.  undated The cliff face with the Mercedes Benz and Jaguars on rocky ledges below--wooded all the way down, the late afternoon sun dripping honey-gold on the face of the rocks.  I looked up past the boulders I was scrambling over to glimpse an old movie theater, one block long, with its original bold marquee lighting intact, transformed into a used car dealership.  Brandon and Rick were up there walking together.  When I joined them I kept my eyes downcast.  Brandon was explaining to us that yes, this place had been a theater, long ago.  Then we were sitting--Rick was reading a paper, and Brandon was talking earnestly, mostly to me, but I could not listen.  Arie was in town for a brief visit and was sitting next to me.  Brandon's eyes were a shocking and almost unbearable blue-green.   Janet Esposito was there, later, in the house of my southern aunt's that I only realized after a long while was a boat.  We were hopping across the lounge, all carpeted and mirrored, so that I could get to the bathroom to change into a nightgown.  We were driving home and my mom wanted my sisters and I to change into night clothes, as we did when we were young, driving back at night from my Nanny's house.  Earlier, my mom and sisters and some southern aunts were walking around by a rehabilitation home for boys, supposedly a good one--a translator next to us was translating everything we said into sign language.  8/30 On the edge of a nightmare--I found myself in the night at Bryce's shop with Rick, cutting black posters down to size.  Suddenly the shop was black, the dark thick as it is just before the beginning of the break of dawn.  Suddenly the heavy tramp of boots outside the door, a burglar, sure to find us.   Natalie Miles and her strange out-of-date 3-D poster advertising a black Christian event, taped to the bumper of her car.  8/31 The people for whom I had made a poster did not like the color--they said I had given them sample prints of a different shade.  The picture itself was of an open room with a door at the far side, all slightly cockeyed, and a child with a stuffed animal in one hand, thumb of the other in mouth, standing slightly off center, afraid of the dark.  They were concerned that it wouldn't look sinister enough--so they told me in the coffeeshop where they had approached me, waving a print that had only been printed with the undercolor.  In reality, the two color posters, printed in lime green and black, had an eerie glow, like the light a flickering television gives off at night in a darkened room, or like forested areas at twilight when the woods themselves seem to give back the day's light.   I was recruiting volunteers to be hung suspended from the ceiling of a gym, representing stars, joined by silver rods one to the other.  I had hung among them as someone from the ground attempted to string us together.  But we didn't have enough people on the ground to collect tickets so I wound up recruiting, when I descended to the floor, for those jobs as well.  9/1 Bryce's shop set on top of a hill surrounded by barbed wire and the remains of old factories.  It was grey winter, bleak light, and I was eyeing the shop, unsure: had I left the shop without locking it up?--I walked by.  The gate was swinging wide open, unpadlocked, the shop door yawning.  Had people gotten in, or had Bryce returned?  Later, much later, up and down the rainbow escalator to the children's library/department--I saw a girl, swimming near a shoal.  She had grown up, she said, around Shillong--apparently that was the locals' term for Hungtington.  I jumped in the water too.  It felt like ants were biting me, beneath the light ripples of the outgoing tide. =20

"and how are you today?" he said.  he was wearing boxers with a tan checked pattern on them.  it was cold but the sun was out brightly warming everything.  "i'm doing very well, especially now that it's warm again," i said.  we went up to a deck that was attached to our studio, which was raised above the ground on a platform behind the tarp office.  the back of the tarp office was level with the deck.  many people were milling about, and a bunch gathered for what i figured out was a monthly meeting forwomen.  we all sat or sprawled on the deck.  we could see, in the opening of the sliding glass door of the tarp office, where a woman in chador and shalwar kameez -- or perhaps it was a strange kimono, yellow and red, very bright -- lay in a heap on the floor.  she had a strong face with a hooked nose and dark skin and beautiful puppy dog eyes.  she looked like a sad clown.  "why ... whyyyyyyyyyyyy," she was calling and crying.  she was calling out as she crawled on her hands and knees towards us, beseeching us. "why, whyyyyyyyy??" she cried as she reached out her arms towards the first group of women closest to the edge of the deck (she must have walked over air to get there), and the women pressed together to grab herhands as one.  she was crying "why" about all war and suffering, but specifically about the war in iraq, and probably also a hatred of bush, i t= hought.  she came to me and i felt an apprehension of embracing a political ideology i did not agree with but i saw in her face real sadness and real confusion, not her own but that of the world,  i held out my hands and i kissed her temple, which was softly scented like baby powder, and warm and dry.  the stand with all sorts of different herbal teas kept getting knocked voer by crawling, so i suggested moving it inside our studio.  we did but when i returned to where i was sittign there were still boxes of tea and herbal-infused tissues scattered on the deck floor.  i was sitting on one, a box of echinacea tea.  the woman next to me lifted it up.

"i have to keep an eye ont he sales," she says, "and make sure the organic cigarette [--the air freshener] is working."  at the very front roomof the shop two owmen are talkigna bout the fabulous sale and wondering why more folk aren't there.  a man is chastising the woman with grey hair for letting moths get into a lampshade.  he makes her eat the moths and they are obviously disgusting.  he is scary.  the woman tastes the ground up moths the man shoves in her mouth, gags visibly, then turns her head and spits them on a cushion.  i am scared what will happen when the man sees the puddle of spit ont he cushion.  he sees it and grows irate.  he is threatening the woman, he is pinching her in a strange, sadistic way and he shoves her into a side closet and makes her kneel int he corner on her knees.  i need to get out of this place and call 911, or get help, i realize. while the man is still in the closet i run out of the shop, downstairs, past tow shops that are closed, finally and with relief finding an art gallery that is open (even though it issunday late afternoon).  i see one personint he shop, the owner, a woman.  "cna i hide here?  and can i use your phone to make an important callt ot he police?"  i ask.  "i am mean, hoeny," the woman says, but i see her face dsoften as she looks at mine, in tears and in panic.

7142 20030218075207 preparedness is your best defense   My old student Veronica was in my classroom.  Many students were in my  classroom, which was not my classroom from Texas but rather a brighter,  more spacious version of my own second-grade classroom in Pod A.  I was  directing my students to do ridiculous things, like filling out classroom-size calendars with sequential numbers.  Once again, I hadn't realized that I was going to be teaching, so I didn't have clear lesson  plans, and students of all grade levels were swarming around the room.   Veronica's father, a city police officer and a quietly imposing guy-- came in, as did Veronica's mother.  Veronica herself was smiling with  her big beautiful rabbit teeth and her wide eyes; she was flitting  around the room picking up things and fluttering them down, saying  "MI-iss" with two syllables as she was wont to do.  I was clearly  leaving my teaching job, or had already left and had just stepped back  into the classroom for a moment, because I had cleaned up my classroom  and reorganized the closets.  I wanted to find some reading  comprehension exercises to work on with Veronica, but the top shelf of the closet, where I normally kept them, was filled with office supplies, artificial sweetener packets, and boxes of phonics exercises.  I kept calling Veronica "Graciela", or something beginning with a G.   Suddenly Veronica, her dad, and I were walking outside to her dad's car.     "You know, I could just give her classes from my MED curriculum," he  said.  I didn't know what that was, so I just nodded.  "'How to Apply and Remove a Tourniquet', 'Reading Comprehension for  Military Instructions', 'Removing Hand Grenade Pins'," he continued.    "Oh."  I nodded again.  The day was sunny, full of warm spring sunlight.   Dogwoods were blooming, and the streets were filled with dappled  shadows.  "You know, Ms. Williams has been a great teacher for Veronica,"  Veronica's dad said.  (Ms. Williams was sis Kate's third-grade teacher,  and a great one.  She was able to help kids be creative and curious and  organized and focused all at the same time.  She  would  be a perfect teacher for Veronica.)  "I never bought all this talk about 'best-practice initiatives' [where  schools or educational researchers identify the practices of effective  teachers and try to systematically instruct other teachers/entire school  districts how to use them] until Veronica landed in this class.  Ms.  Williams is a great teacher."  "Yes, she is," I said. "She has a teacher's innate compassion as well  as years of experience."  "Yes, she's a lot better than you...and that other teacher." I was  thinking of Veronica's fourth and fifth grade teachers.  But he continued, "That other teacher, Ms. Soo-Lin."  "Oh," I said again.  "Yes." Veronica's dad was driving away.  I was  standing in front of an old Victorian house waiting for Veronica's mom  to come by and pick her up.  One of the women from the mental  institution where I work came by in an old car to pick up Veronica and  her mom.      ceci n'est pas un pipe   A single vision of a spindled cherry or walnut rocking chair, encased in  resin or wax.  #%#date=20030217102607 xt=  'How very strange,' thought Milo as he finished his seventh helping.  'Each one I eat makes me a little hungrier than before.'   The Phantom Tollbooth  , "This Way to Infinity"  In my dream I dreamt I woke and had to go about the mundane task of recording my dream.  When I woke up I was not only confused, but exhausted.  I felt like I had been awake for hours, although strangely this was the first night in about three weeks that I had slept through the night-- without waking around three a.m.  In my dream Rick was running a rock tumbler at my parents' house.  Worm-like appendages were growing off his leg, urged on by the non-stop "rrr-rrr-rrr" of the rock tumbler. His friend Allen had attempted a similar experiment successfully--apparently the worm-like appendages were a desired outcome.  Rick seemed overly concerned that my dad not find out that he was running the tumbler.    We had been skeptical that all the outlets in my parents' room worked.  However, Rick later reasoned that if the rock tumbler worked (it was running off an outlet on the second floor of the house) the outlets on the third floor loft had to work as well.  Somehow, though, the wiring worked to prevent my father, who was sleeping in  his room, from hearing the noise of the rock tumbler.  I dreamt I was at a special camp.  The participants had been split into two sections--there was an artsy section and a science section. I had been supposed to go to the science section but wound up in the artsy section.  It was the last day of the artsy section and people were getting ready to go.    Outside in a large, sun-dried field, two separate fenced-in areas enclosed several elephants and other circus/safari animals. The animals in the farther-away fenced in area were wild, or at least as wild as you can be if you are fenced in.  The others were part of a circus that had come to town.  The wild animals kept trumpeting loudly at the injustices they felt the animals in the other fenced-in area were facing.  The ringmaster or animal trainer kept walking by with a large whip and a menacing look.  He didn't do anything to the circus animals, but I think it's because he was afraid the other animals would charge him if he did.  I was saying goodbye to my friends from the camp.   I alone from the group was going to return to the science section for the indeterminate length of time until it ended.  A friend was returning to her small children.  We walked together to the woods, which were the woods behind my parents' house, except much more crowded with trees and compressed geographically.  In a hollow just inside the woods, someone had built an ampitheater with seats of long column-like stone.  The friend I had said goodbye to disappeared off to the bus; I saw my friend Danielle and said goodbye.  At this point, I woke up in my dream.  I realized I needed to write down my dream and started recording it in my journal (since I was at my parents' house, I knew I need to write it out first before I could get on the computer).  At the same time, I realized a rock tumbler was sitting out in my parents' backyard.    "Hey, that was in my dream," I thought, and went to clear out the rocks from it.  I was sorting them by color. My sister Sarah and a guy from our high school were standing by the coal shed. They kept taking the rocks from me and trying to sort them, as well, into the depressions of an egg carton. Many of the stones were blue, deep blue like lapis lazuli or lighter blue like blue chalcedony.  Some were grey to white like agate, or pink to red like carnelian.  I woke up (really, this time) to Wilco's "Outtasite (Outta Mind)" playing  very quietly  on the jukebox.  So quietly that when I went into the office to see if that's what was really playing, I had to turn it up five notches to actually hear it.  Then I realized that I hadn't recorded my dream--or woken up, for that matter--earlier, as I thought I had.    
7812 20060218125408 Earlier, I was riding in the car with my family.  We stopped in front of the big mall to pick up Kate, who had to attend to business there.  When she got to the car I realized that something was wrong.  I relaized that Kate had forgotten to pick up my glasses, which she was supposed to do inside.  "I'm so sorry, Ali," Kate said, but I was mad because I would not be able to see the entire trip.  So as my mom was driving I made her circle around and without her even stopping the car I jumped out.  When my parents tried to shout out to ask me what my plan was or how I was ogign to meet up with them, I first ignored them and then rudely flipped off the car as I walked into the store.  I honestly had no ideahow I was going to find my glasses.  Inside, set up like a giant supermarket.  I brushed past all the aisles of displays, the new employees receiving training on how to divvy up and distribute samples.  In the back I suddenly emerged into the office of Finer Things, and there was Kim wearing my glasses.  She seemed surprised to see me so soon and I realized I hadn't been expectd to show up for another seven hours or so.  But she gave me the glasses.  In the room with Ryan Bernholz.  Looking over the fence in his backyward, with Jay Brazier at our side.  Tiffany Dyer-Denton lived next door to Ryan now, and she had set up a stage and a tumbling area in which to perform various gymnastics in order to instruct and entertain. Ryan and Jay thought it was weird but I was trying to defend it.  Jay Brazier still lookd the same as in high school.  Ryan kept asking me if I remembered this one kid that used to live down the street fromus (but not in real life), and I did remember him, but when I asked, "The one with sandy hair?", Ryan just kept saying no and repeating the kid's name.  He had "light brown salt-and-pepper hair".  I woke up momentarily with the lady from Morcheeba singing a new song, "Before we reach our psychosis / We turn ourselves to the roses".  In the classroom that was also a bedroom, with a bed in the back, I was preparing notes for a substitute teacher that might or might not wind up covering a class.  I tore out a page of one student's notebook but she was apparently a substitute teacher as well -- she had jotted down notes or lesson plans on various pages of her book.  Later I wound up inadvertantly stealing her book when someone came by to pick me up.  Earlier we had all been looking at a big relief map of the world, but primarily the Northern and Western hemisphere.  People were marking off where they had been.  Amy Weidner marked off a part in upper Canada and I thought that she had marked off a tiny section of Siberia.  But someone else exclaimed, "How awful and crowded!" about the place she had been and Amy agreed, but said that it was the only place she'd had a chance to go. "Tigua" was the name of a small island in the Pacific but off the coast of Alaska, and someone thought it was funny because the Beach Boys had sung abotu it intheir song "Kokomo": "Aruba, Jamaica, ooo I wanna take you / Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama / Key Largomon, Tigua, baby why don't we go", she sang.  I was sitting next to Ryan who was laying on the bed and who seemed changed on some level, less dismissive and more openly encouraging of my strangeness?  At some point everyone in the room had to leave and I relaized with some embarrassment that I had bled on the sheets somehow. I was walking outside with a guy who was like our friend Nick Szydlowski who was telling me about the books that he had written and was showing me pictures I really wanted to see.  Somehow they related, too, to images I know had inthe book I had inadvertantly stolen from the student.  But then everything was in a fluster because it was time for everyone to get back on the road.    We were miles away from everyone's home, in a rocky valley with tall hills covered with grass.  It felt like an American version if an Alpine meadow.  I had barely gotten to see my Aunt Ginny but she had to get back onthe road and move.  My mom had to drive back home but was trying to figure out when she would come back to Nashville to visit.  I wound up getting in the car with my parents again.  We were at my parents' house, getting in the car.  But then we started walking up the hill on Shore Road.  The road rapidly changed into another landscape, with the woods denser and the feelignthey stretched on for a long way, perhaps like we were not even on an island anymore.  As my dad talked about our section of Mount Sinai gradually seceding from the rest of the hamlet to become its own entity, we reached a natural bridge of stone, carved by water many years ago, now dry.  We walked around its curves as my dad explained how Margaret Alfano had researched the legal means by which a segment of one city can withdraw, and how her research had prompted her to "renew her unicorn", which apparently was slang for renewing a law license.    Kate and Sarah were with us but they were babies, just about two-and-a-half years old, who could barely toddle along the path.  The trail turned narrow and steep.  On one side were thick woods and the other a steep slope, white smooth rock like worn quartz, but a solid slab.  Kate and Sarah kept wandering off the side, Kate especially, and I was afraid. At one point Kate kept descending further and further, and the walls were so steep I didn't know what she might fall to below.  I turend and walked to the edge and said, "Kate, stop, don't move," but she kept stepping backwards.  I went down to help her but I was too far away and my arms were too small.  Delaney Gill had been hiking with us and she reached out her long arms to pick up Kate by her long black hair, and set her up on level ground.  We kept walking: the path got wider and we came into the pool hall and bar where we were supposed to meet up with the Gill sisters to play pool.  This was a bar that my mom and I had gone to in a dream many years ago, but from a different side, so I didn't know this section existed.  We wandered around for a while searching for the pool spot where we were supposed to meet Delaney, Casey, and Jenny and their boyfriends, but could not find it.  On the wall above a big staircase, there was an istallation of art from a Watkings student.  Some of the pieces had been taken down to go into a different exhbiti, but they still had sketches where the artist had planned how to install them.  They were like wall-mounted dioramas with moving parts.  One was a histroy of the Plains Indian.  Another was about microbes, and the parts, shifted back and forth like hands on a clock, but only from side to side.   Looking at the wall, I realized that water was coming out of it: there were giant pipes in the wall conducting water from outside through the wall (which was partially below ground) into a subterranean river.  By this point we had met up withthe Gill sisters, who hadn't been that excited by the pool offering.  We were tryign to walk back along the same narrow path.  We saw Kate and Sarah, still little, and an "Asian guinea pig" (actually a kinkajou) in the arms of a lady who looked like Imelda Marcos, in a tree very high up on the side of the path.  People were trying to rescue them out of the tree.  But when they brought them back, one of my sisters had had her head severed at the neck. "BRING THEM BACK TO LIFE!!!" I was shouting very loudly and a large woman all in white with white head wrap who looked like a voodoo priestess came over and put the head back on and started smearing blood ont he severed part.  She gave me the book of Grimm's Fairy tales to read, and I turned to "Faithful John", which is what I had been thinking about when I was shouting for someone to bring the twins back to life.
